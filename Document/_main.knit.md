# Executive summary{-}

## Stock{-}

This assessment reports the status of Black Rockfish (_Scientific name_) off the US West coast using data through xxxx.
The assessments described in this document apply to the black rockfish (Sebastes melanops) stocks that reside in the waters from Point Conception (34\textdegree27' N latitude) in the south to the U.S. boundary with Canada (approximately 48\textdegree30' N latitude).  Following the consensus recommendations from a preliminary stock assessment workshop in April 2015 (PFMC 2015), the stock assessment team (STAT) decided to prepare separate geographic stock assessments that are spatially stratified with boundaries at the CA/OR border (42\textdegree00' N latitude) and OR/WA border (46\textdegree16' N latitude).  

Black rockfish are also caught from the waters off British Columbia and Alaska, but there have not been any formal assessments of stock status for those areas.

## Catches{-}

Black rockfish are caught by a wide variety of gear types and in recent decades have been a very important target species for recreational charter-boats and private sport anglers in Washington and Oregon, and to a lesser extent in California.  In recent years the recreational fishery has accounted for most of the black rockfish catches (Figure ES-1 to Figure ES-3).  Black rockfish can also be an important component of nearshore commercial fisheries, either as incidental catch by the troll fishery for salmon or as directed catch by jig fisheries for groundfish.  Further, in California and Oregon there are nearshore fisheries that catch and sell fish live for the restaurant trade.  Washington closed nearshore commercial fisheries in state water in late 1990s and never allowed the live-fish fishery to develop. In all states there have been almost no trawl-caught landings of black rockfish in recent years (Table ES-1), but trawl landings in the past were substantial (Figure ES-1 to Figure ES-3).

Detailed reports of commercial landings of black rockfish are generally unavailable prior to 1981, when the Pacific Fishery Information Network (PacFIN) database began.  The catch series prior to 1981 for these assessments were derived by applying available estimates or assumed values for the proportion of black rockfish landings in reported landings of rockfish.  Observer data, which are available only for the past decade, indicate low levels of discarding of black rockfish, generally less than 2% of total catch.

Because of their nearshore distribution and low abundance compared to other rockfish species, black rockfish are unlikely to have ever comprised a large percentage of rockfish landings, but it seems quite certain that they have been more than a trivial component for many years.  Black rockfish were one of only four rockfish species mentioned by scientific name in reports of rockfish landings in Oregon during the 1940s, and they were one of only six rockfish species mentioned by scientific name in reports of rockfish landings in California during the same period. Mentions of black rockfish extend back before the year 1900 in Washington.

## Data and assessment{-}

The last stock assessments for black rockfish were conducted in 2007 for areas north and south of Cape Falcon (45\textdegree46' North latitude). The current assessments assume three areas instead of two, delineated by the state lines as was agreed upon at a pre-assessment and data workshop in March 2015. The prior assessments used Stock Synthesis 2, while the current assessments use Stock Synthesis
