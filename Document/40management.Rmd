# Management 

## Reference Points

Reference points were based on the rockfish FMSY proxy ($\text{SPR}_{50\%}$), target relative biomass (40%), and estimated selectivity and catch for each fleet (Table \ref{tab:ReferencePoints}). The `r spp` population in Oregon at the start of 2023 is estimated to be 1.38 times (above) the target biomass, and fishing intensity during 2022 is estimated to be 0.96 times (below) the fishing intensity target (Figure \ref{fig:phase}).  The yield values are lower than the previous assessment for similar reference points due to updated life history estimates. The proxy MSY values of management quantities are the most conservative compared to the estimated MSY and MSY relative to 40% biomass. Sustainable total yield, removals, using the proxy $\text{SPR}_{50\%}$ is `r format(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value'], digits = 3, scientific = FALSE, big.mark = ',')` mt. The spawning output equivalent to 40 percent of the unfished spawning output ($\text{SO}_{40\%}$) calculated using the SPR target ($\text{SPR}_{50\%}$) was `r format(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'SSB_SPR', 'Value'], digits = 4, scientific = FALSE, big.mark = ',')` meggs. 

Recent removals have been close to the point estimate of potential long-term yields calculated using an $\text{SPR}_{50\%}$ reference point, though the population size has continued to increase over recent years due to several above average recruitments. The equilibrium estimates of yield relative to biomass based on a steepness value fixed at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"], 2)` are provided in Figure \ref{fig:yield}, where vertical dashed lines indicate the estimate of fraction unfished at the start of `r endyr +1` (current) and the estimated management targets calculated based on the relative target biomass (B target), the SPR target, and the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). 

The 2023 spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass, based on the 2022 fishing year, is above (55 percent) the management target of 40 percent of unfished spawning output. The relative biomass and the ratio of the estimated SPR to the management target ($\text{SPR}_{50\%}$) across all model years are shown in Figure \ref{fig:phase} where warmer colors (red) represent early years and colder colors (blue) represent recent years.  There have been periods where the stock status has decreased below the target and fishing intensity has been higher than the target fishing intensity based on $\text{SPR}_{50\%}$.


## Management performance

`r spp` removals have generally been below the equivalent ABC-ACL over the recent decade, with the exception of 2017 and 2022 when removals were slightly higher (Table \ref{tab:manage}). Exploitation on `r spp` increased starting around 1940 and reached a high in the late 1970s. Since that time, catch has mostly fluctuated between 300 and 500 mt per year, with some years exceeding 600 mt. Removals have averaged 483 mt over the past decade. The last ten years of `r spp` acceptable biological catch (ABC) and annual catch limit (ACL) (which are equivalent) has been set, by definition, below the overfishing limit (OFL) (Table \ref{tab:manage}). Prior to 2017, management specifications were set for `r spp` in California and Oregon waters combined.  The `r spp` OFL has not been exceeded by Oregon removals over the past decade.


## Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties

The biggest uncertainty and unresolved conflict is trying to reconcile the signal in the biological data (which suggests a lower population size and status) versus the acoustic and tag surveys (which suggest high stock sizes and status). This is the major issue the current assessment is confronting. Another acoustic-visual survey data point could help resolve how much uncertainty there is in the estimate. The lack of contrast in the biological data, despite large sample sizes, is another barrier to interpreting the current conditions, though given models using only biological data, the signal seems clear that the population could be at a lower stock status.


## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

The following text will be modified, as appropriate, after the STAR panel and SSC meeting.

The `r spp` assessment is being considered as a category 2 assessment with a $P^*$ = 0.45, sigma = 0.72, and a time-varying buffer applied to the OFL.  These multipliers are also combined with the rockfish MSY proxy of FSPR=50% MSY and the 40-10 harvest control rule to calculate OFLs, ABCs and ACLs. A twelve year (2023-2034) projection of the reference model using these specifications along with input removals for 2023 and 2024 provided by the Groundfish Management Team is provided in Table \ref{tab:project}.

Uncertainty in management quantities for the reference model was characterized by exploring various model specifications in a decision table. Initial explorations considered alternative specifications of catchability for the acoustic-visual survey. The resultant decision table will be provided in Table \ref{tab:dec-tab}.

Further details about selecting the decision table states of nature will be added here after the STAR panel.    

Further details summarizing the results presented in the decision table will be added here after the STAR panel.


## Evaluation of Scientific Uncertainty

The model-estimated uncertainty around the `r endyr+1` spawning biomass was $\sigma$ = `r round(model$Pstar_sigma,2)` and the uncertainty around the OFL was $\sigma$ = `r round(model$OFL_sigm, 2)`. This is clearly an underestimate of overall uncertainty because of the necessity to fix some life history parameters such as natural mortality and steepness, as well as a lack of explicit incorporation of model structural uncertainty. The alternative states of nature used to bracket uncertainty in the decision table assist with encapsulating model structure uncertainty. 


## Research and Data Needs

Recommended avenues for research to help improve future `r spp` stock assessments:

1. Continue work on the investigation into the movement, and behavior or mortality of older (> age 10) females to further reconcile their absence in fisheries data. 
2. Conduct population genetics studies on fish observed off of the continental shelf (middle of the gyre and at sea mounts) to determine their association with the nearshore stocks.
3. Continue to build evidence for appropriate natural mortality values for females and males. 
4. Improved historical catch reconstructions. Specifically, tThe historic trawl fishery catches (pre-1987) in particular require particular attention. Given the huge historical removals of that fleet in each state, the assessment is very sensitive to the assumed functional form of selectivity. A synoptic catch reconstruction is recommended, where states work together to resolve cross-boundarystate catch issues as well as standardize the approach to catch recommendations to the extent possible.
5. Stock structure for black rockfish is a complicated topic that needs further analysis. How this is determined (e.g., exploitation history, genetics, life history variability, biogeography, etc.) and what this means for management units needs to be further refined. This is a general issue for all nearshore stocks that likely have significant and small scale stock structure among and within states, but limited data collections to support small-scale management.
6. Continue acoustic-visual fisheries independent coastwide survey to develop a time series. Further refine the survey by addressing the recommendations of the SSC methodology review from 2022. Examine the potential of using spatial modeling to reduce the uncertainty in the population estimates from the acoustic-visual fisheries independent coastwide survey.
7. Reconcile contradictory signal in the Black Rockfish biology versus the population scale.
8. Better understand the ecology and habitats of Black Rockfish from settlement to age 1. Further development of surveys aimed specifically at recruitment or settlement rates of nearshore species, such as OSUâ€™s SMURF collections, that are not frequently encountered in offshore federal age-0 surveys is needed.
