# Introduction

This assessment report describes the stock of `r Spp` (*Sebastes melanops*) off the Oregon coast in U.S. waters, using data through 2022. The stocks of `r Spp` in Washington, Oregon, and California waters are each modeled as separate stocks with the population estimates reported in stock-specific assessment reports (Figure \ref{fig:map}). This assessment does not account for populations located in other areas off the U.S. West Coast and assumes that California and Washington populations do not contribute to nor take from the Oregon population being assessed here. 

## Basic Information
`r Spp` (*Sebastes melanops*) are an important component of the recreational fisheries in the nearshore waters off central and northern California, Oregon, and Washington, as well as the non-trawl commercial fisheries in California and Oregon. They range as far north as Amchitka and Kodiak islands in Alaska and are considered uncommon south of central California [@love_rockfishes_2002].  

An early assessment of `r spp` considered the population off Oregon and California [@ralston_status_2003]. This assessment reviewed the evidence supporting genetic stock structure for `r spp` and other rockfish off the U.S. West Coast. This work concluded that the Oregon and California populations of `r spp` are probably not genetically heterogeneous.  That assessment treated the `r spp` off California and Oregon as a unit stock.  Previous assessments of `r spp` off Washington [@wallace_status_1999; @wallace_status_2007] describe a study of coastal `r spp` genetic structure using 10 sampled sites collected from northern California to southern British Columbia.  Results of that study supported the notion of separate genetic stocks north and south of Cape Falcon, Oregon.  However, a later study [@baker_genetic_1999] using `r spp` collected from eight sites along the northern Oregon coast concluded that `r spp` from north and south of Cape Falcon were genetically very similar.

Although a stock boundary line at the Columbia River seems reasonable for `r spp`, both because it is a state fishery management boundary and because the Columbia River plume is likely to be somewhat of a natural barrier (impediment) to the north-south exchange of `r spp` adults and larvae, the 2007 assessment of `r spp` off Oregon and California [@sampson_status_2007] differed slightly from Ralston and Dick [-@ralston_status_2003] by placing the northern boundary at Cape Falcon rather than at the Columbia River.  The boundary was changed to avoid overlap with the separate northern assessment [@wallace_status_2007] and to simplify the process of assembling historical commercial landings data, which are largely available in terms of Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission (PMFC) statistical areas. Given the spatial resolution of the historical commercial fishery data, it is problematic to estimate the catch of `r spp` taken north of Cape Falcon but south of the Columbia River. Addressing the spatial distribution of the catch around the OR-WA state boundary was a major focus of both the 2015 `r spp` assessment [@cope_assessments_2016] and the current assessment. 

The 2015 `r spp` assessment delineated the stock at state borders and three models were used to estimate a coastwide stock status [@cope_assessments_2016]. This approach was considered consistent with two ideas: (a) that nearshore species do not exhibit much adult movement and (b) exploitation and management histories have varied significantly among the three states. This stratification was maintained in the current assessment and this document addresses the portion of the `r spp` stock in Oregon waters. 

In Oregon, accounting for location of capture is problematic for historic commercially caught fish, primarily for trawl gear types, which was the predominant gear type during the 1940s to 1970s. For state-specific regional assessments the commercially caught `r spp` were apportioned to assessment region based on the port of landing, with the exception of trawl caught fish landed into Astoria, OR. Most of these fish were found to have been caught off Washington and most of the trawl landings into Astoria were therefore included with the catch history for the Washington assessment region. This approach was refined in the current assessment to allow for state-specific species compositions to be applied to aggregated trawl landings. Details are provided in Section 2.1.1 Commercial Landings and Discards.

## Life History
Adult `r spp` tend to occur in schools over rocky structure at depths less than 40 fathoms, and sometimes feed actively on or near the surface.  They feed on a wide variety of prey including zooplankton, krill, mysids, sand lance, and juvenile rockfish, and are subject to predation by Lingcod and marine mammals [@love_rockfishes_2002]. 

Although tagging studies have documented some individuals moving long distances (several hundreds of miles), the vast majority of recaptured individuals were found close to the areas of initial capture and tagging [@culver_1987;@ayres_tag_1988;@wallace_tag_2010;@starr_green_2007].  Results from a 2004-05 study off Newport, OR of 42 `r spp` implanted with acoustic tags indicated that all but seven fish remained within range of a 3 x 5 km array of acoustic receivers during one full year of monitoring and had relatively small home ranges that did not vary seasonally [@parker_etal_2007].  Green and Starr [-@green_starr_2007] report similar findings from a study in Carmel Bay, CA of 23 acoustically tagged small `r spp`. An extensive Washington state tagging study also supported low movements for most individuals, with some exceptional movements recorded [@wallace_tag_2010].

Like all members of the genus Sebastes, `r spp` have internal fertilization and bear live young approximately two months after insemination. `r spp` are quite fecund, with a six-year-old female annually producing about 300,000 embryos and a 16-year-old producing about 950,000 embryos [@bobko_berkeley_2004].  Recent studies have demonstrated that the relative number and quality of larvae increase with age in female `r spp` [@berkeley_etal_2004; @hixon_etal_1987]. Parturition of larvae occurs during winter [@wyllie_echeverria_1987] and larvae and small juveniles are pelagic for several months to a year [@boehlert_yoklavich_1983].  Settlement occurs in estuaries, tide-pools, and in the nearshore at depths less than 20 m [@stein_hassler_1989].  

`r spp` begin recruiting to nearshore fisheries at 3-4 years of age, corresponding to a fork length of about 25-30 cm, and 50% of females attain maturity at about 6-8 years, corresponding to a fork length of about 38-42 cm.  Adult female `r spp` grow 3-5 cm larger than males, with a few females attaining fork lengths greater than 55 cm.

## Ecosystem Considerations
`r spp` acts as both a major predator (adult stage) and prey (larvae to juvenile stages) in mostly nearshore areas. The California Current is a highly variable and dynamic system, and it has been recognized for years that rockfishes are subject to large swings in recruitment that are tied to environmental conditions. It is believe to be one of the reasons rockfishes exhibit long lives and the ability to go years without significant recruitment, but can produce large recruitment events when conditions are favorable (a phenomenon known as the "storage effect").

`r spp` off central Oregon have recently been shown to exhibit changes in larval and juvenile growth rates that correlate with prey abundance and water temperature, to name just a few of the factors [@fennie_larval_2023]. Settlement rates exhibited a dome-shaped relationship, demonstrating a "window" of good growth conditions for successful settlement. `r spp` mature at a relatively young age. This assessment uses a functional maturity relationship, updated from the previous assessment that used a biological maturity relationship. 

No formal (e.g., inclusion of environmental indices) ecosystem considerations have been made given the lack of data for such an undertaking. McClure et al. [-@mcclure_vulnerability_2023] report the climate vulnerability for several west coast groundfishes, including `r spp`. `r spp` demonstrated both high biological sensitivity and high climate exposure risk, to give it an overall high vulnerability score to climate change. This result should also be considered with the fact that like many rockfishes, periods of low productivity is not unusual to `r spp` and their extended longevity has historically allowed them to wait for advantageous productivity periods. Additional stressors such as fishing and climate change that possibly truncate longevity could bring significant challenges to population sustainability.

## Historical and Current Fishery Information 
`r spp` are harvested by a wide variety of fishing methods including trawling, trolling, and hook-and-line fishing with jigs and longlines.  `r spp` are a major component of the nearshore fixed gear groundfish fishery, known as the "live-fish" fishery, and as incidental catch in the troll fishery for salmon and groundfish. Historically, `r spp` was a common, though more incidental, component of the trawl fishery. With the decline of salmon fishing opportunities in the 1980s and 1990s, `r spp` became a vital target of marine recreational fisheries in Oregon, especially during periods of restricted or slack fishing for salmon, halibut, and tuna.  

Recreational harvest of `r spp` has become the dominant source of removals in Oregon. Since 1990, annual recreational harvests of `r spp` have averaged 315.1 tons off Oregon. Commercial annual harvests by non-trawl gear types during the same period averaged 127.9 mt in Oregon. Harvests by trawl on average during this period have been less than 3 mt annually.

Removal histories have been a significant axis of uncertainty in the past assessments of `r spp`. A major task for the 2007 assessments of `r spp` in was developing a plausible reconstruction of historical landings of `r spp` and exploring the consequences of those landings. A formal commercial catch reconstruction had been recently developed in Oregon [@karnowski_historical_2014] for the 2015 `r spp` assessment, but was subsequently modified to better delineate trawl landings in Oregon and Washington [@cope_assessments_2016]. This current assessment also utilizes a recent recreational catch reconstruction [@whitman_oregon_2023]. 

## Summary of Management History and Performance
Prior to 2000 the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC or Council) managed the federal fishery for `r spp` as part of the *Sebastes* complex, with no separate Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) or Optimum Yield (OY) for `r spp`.  Beginning in 2000, the Council established an ABC of 1,200 mt for `r spp` caught north of Cape Mendocino (in the Eureka, Columbia, and Vancouver INPFC statistical areas), but left `r spp` south of Cape Mendocino as part of the "other rockfish" category.  Oregon `r spp` continued to be managed as a part of a complex following the 2003 and 2007 assessments, as these assessments combined the Oregon portion of the stock with California [@ralston_status_2003; @sampson_status_2007]. 

The 2015 `r spp` assessment split the stock into three units for modeling, including California, Oregon and Washington. This was the first time the Oregon `r spp` stock was assessed in isolation [@cope_assessments_2016]. Following the implementation of harvest specifications from this assessment, Oregon `r spp` were moved in 2017 for the purpose of management to the Oregon Black/Blue/Deacon complex, and manangement of `r spp` within this complex has continued since that time. The OFLs have not been exceeded since this complex was created. However, the Oregon-specific ACLs were exceeded in 2017 and in 2022 (Table \ref{tab:manage}). 

In Oregon, `r spp` are allocated to both the commercial and recreational fisheries. The primary commercial fishery for `r spp` is the nearshore live-fish fishery, which is managed as a year-round fishery with annual state harvest caps and two-month trip limits. The commercial nearshore fishery first developed as an open access fishery in the early 1990s and transitioned to a State limited-entry permit system in 2004. The commercial nearshore fleet is composed of small vessels that target shallow nearshore rocky reefs using mostly hook and line jig or bottom longline fishing gear. 

As noted above, `r spp` is the predomiant species in the recreational fishery, which is managed using annual harvest guidelines, daily bag limits, and different types of spatial and temporal closures. Oregon had no recreational bag limits for marine fishes until 1976 when the state established a 25-fish limit.  In 1978 the state established a daily limit of 15 fish for each angler's combined bag of rockfish, Cabezon and greenling, which stayed in effect until 1994 when the state established a ten-fish-per-angler daily bag limit specifically for `r spp`.  Over time, the bag limits for marine species, of which `r spp` is the primary species, have gradually declined from ten in 2000 to four or five fish in recent years (2017 - 2022). The use of in-season spatial closures to regulate effort have become common as well. In-season adjustments to regulations can be made more restrictive or less restrictive, depending on circumstances and the prospects for early attainment of harvest caps. Seasonal depth restrictions (e.g., inside 30 fathoms April 1 to September 30) are one tool used regularly in recent years to control the fishery, driven largely by the need to avoid bycatch of the primary rebuilding species, Canary Rockfish and Yelloweye Rockfish.

Some recent important regulations or management events include the following:

* 2000: `r spp` began to be managed by the Council as a minor nearshore species.  Commercial trip limits were significantly reduced, with specific restrictions applying to `r spp`. 
* 2002: Oregon adopted an Interim Nearshore Fishery Management Plan in anticipation of increased pressure on nearshore stocks due to reduced fishing opportunities for groundfish in federal waters.  Regulations included fishing-sector specific caps on retained harvests, set approximately at the levels attained in 2000.
* 2003: The Council established Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs) to control catches of overfished rockfish species, and large portions of the shelf were closed to fishing.  Differential trip limits were applied north and south of a management boundary at 40\textdegree10' N. latitude for nearshore *Sebastes* species. Nearshore permittees in Oregon became subject to depth restrictions consistent with the shoreward non-trawl RCA boundary.
* 2004: The Oregon nearshore commercial fishery became a limited-entry permit system. Trip limits were established. The sport fishery in Oregon closed in September 2004 due to early attainment of the state's limit for sport-caught `r spp`.  This was the first time that the sport rockfish fishery in Oregon had not been open all year.
* 2005: The recreational fishery in Oregon closed early.
* 2007: Black/Blue rockfish harvest cap was attained early and the nearshore commercial fishery closed for remainder of year. 
* 2017: The recreational fishery in Oregon closed early. 

## Canadian and Alaska Fisheries
`r spp` is one of multiple Inshore Rockfish species on the West Coast of British Columbia. The most recent evaluation was completed by Yamanaka and Lacko (-@yamanaka_inshore_2001), which determined that there was insufficient information to recommend a `r spp`-specific catch quotas for the five management areas on the Pacific coast of British Columbia. `r spp` continues to be a "Non-Quota" species in the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Management Plan [@dfo_fmp_2014]. 

Directed fisheries for `r spp` in Alaska are limited. In the Westward region (Kodiak area) of Alaska, an acoustic visual survey has been the primary management tool used to determine population size. An age-structured assessment for `r spp` is under development by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game that will use the data from this acoustic visual survey as the primary data source. No assessments have been developed for `r spp` for the Southeast or Central regions in the Gulf of Alaska.
