# Introduction
## Basic Information
`r Spp` (*Sebastes melanops*) are an important component of the recreational fisheries in the nearshore waters off central and northern California, Oregon, and Washington, as well as the non-trawl commercial fisheries in California and Oregon. They range as far north as Amchitka and Kodiak islands in Alaska and are considered uncommon south of central California [@love_rockfishes_2002].  

A first assessment of `r spp` off considered the population off Oregon and California [@ralston_status_2003] and reviewed the evidence supporting genetic stock structure for `r spp` and other rockfish off the U.S. West Coast and concluded that the Oregon and California populations of `r spp` are probably not genetically heterogeneous.  That assessment treated the `r spp` off California and Oregon as a unit stock.  Previous assessments of `r spp` off Washington [@wallace_status_1999; @wallace_status_2007] describe a study of coastal `r spp` genetic structure using 10 sampled sites collected from northern California to southern British Columbia.  Results of that study supported the notion of separate genetic stocks north and south of Cape Falcon.  However, a later study [@baker_genetic_1999] of `r spp` collected from eight sites along the northern Oregon coast concluded that `r spp` from north and south of Cape Falcon were genetically very similar.

Although a stock boundary line at the Columbia River seems reasonable for `r spp`, both because it is a state fishery management boundary and because the Columbia River plume is likely to be a natural barrier to the north-south exchange of `r spp` adults and larvae, the 2007 assessment of `r spp` off Oregon and California [@sampson_status_2007] differed slightly from Ralston and Dick [-@ralston_status_2003] in placing the northern boundary at Cape Falcon rather than at the Columbia River.  The boundary was changed to avoid overlap with the separate northern assessment [@wallace_status_2007] and to simplify the process of assembling historical commercial landings data, which are largely available in terms of Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission (PMFC) statistical areas. Given the spatial resolution of the historical commercial fishery data, it is problematic to estimate the catch of `r spp` taken north of Cape Falcon but south of the Columbia River. Addressing the spatial distribution of the catch around the OR-WA state boundary was a major focus of both the 2015 `r spp` assessment (@cope_assessments_2016) and the current assessment. 

The 2015 `r spp` assessment delineated the stock at state borders and three models were used to estimate a coastwide stock status (@cope_assessments_2016). This approach was considered consistent with two ideas: (a) these nearshore species do not exhibit much adult movement and (b) exploitation and management histories have varied significantly among the three states. This stratification was maintained in the current assessment and this document addresses `r spp` in Oregon. 

In Oregon, accounting for location of capture is problematic for historic commercially caught fish, primarily for trawl gear types, which was the predominant gear type during that era. For these regional assessments the commercially caught `r spp` were apportioned to assessment region based on the port of landing, with the exception of trawl caught fish landed into Astoria, OR. Most of these fish were found to have been caught off Washington and most of the trawl landings into Astoria were therefore included with the catch history for the Washington assessment region. This approach was refined in the current assessment to allow for state-specific species compositions to be applied to aggregated trawl landings. Details are provided in Section ADD REFERENCE TO SECTION.

## Life History
Adult `r spp` tend to occur in schools over rocky structure at depths less than 40 fathoms, and sometimes feed actively on or near the surface.  They feed on a wide variety of prey including zooplankton, krill, mysids, sand lance, and juvenile rockfish, and are subject to predation by lingcod and marine mammals [@love_rockfishes_2002]. 

Although tagging studies have documented some individuals moving long distances (several hundreds of miles), the vast majority of recaptured individuals were found close to the areas of initial capture and tagging [@culver_1987;@ayres_tag_1988;@wallace_tag_2010;@starr_green_2007].  Results from a 2004-05 study off Newport, OR of 42 `r spp` implanted with acoustic tags indicated that all but seven fish remained within range of a 3 x 5 km array of acoustic receivers during one full year of monitoring and had relatively small home ranges that did not vary seasonally [@parker_etal_2007].  Green and Starr [-@green_starr_2007] report similar findings from a study in Carmel Bay, CA of 23 acoustically tagged `r spp`. The extensive Washington state tagging study also supported low movements for most individuals, with some exceptional movements recorded [@wallace_tag_2010].

Like all members of the genus Sebastes, `r spp` have internal fertilization and bear live young approximately two months after insemination. `r spp` are quite fecund, with a six-year-old female annually producing about 300,000 embryos and a 16-year-old producing about 950,000 embryos [@bobko_berkeley_2004].  Recent studies have demonstrated that the relative number and quality of larvae increase with age in female `r spp` [@berkeley_etal_2004; @hixon_etal_1987]. Parturition of larvae occurs during winter [@wyllie_echeverria_1987] and larvae and small juveniles are pelagic for several months to a year [@boehlert_yoklavich_1983].  Settlement occurs in estuaries, tide-pools, and in the nearshore at depths less than 20 m [@stein_hassler_1989].  

`r spp` begin recruiting to nearshore fisheries at 3-4 years of age, corresponding to a fork length of about 25-30 cm, and 50% of females attain maturity at about 6-8 years, corresponding to a fork length of about 38-42 cm.  Adult female `r spp` grow 3-5 cm larger than males, with a few females attaining fork lengths greater than 55 cm.

## Ecosystem Considerations
The prominent position of `r spp` as both a major predator (adult stage) and prey (larvae to juvenile stages) in mostly nearshore areas suggest it to be a notable player in the nearshore ecosystem. The California Current is a highly variable and dynamic system, and it has been recognized for years that rockfishes are subject to large swings in recruitment that are tied to environmental conditions. It is believe to be one of the reasons rockfishes exhibit long lives and the ability to go years without significant recruitment, but can produce large recruitment events when conditions are favorable (a phenomenon known as the "storage effect").

`r spp` off central Oregon have recently been shown to exhibit changes in larval and juvenile growth rates that correlate with prey abundance and water temperature, to name just a few of the factors [@fennie_larval_2023]. Settlement rates exhibited a dome-shaped relationship, demonstrating a "window" of good growth conditions for successful settlement. This assessment uses an updated functional maturity relationship. 

No formal (e.g., inclusion of environmental indices) ecosystem considerations have been made given the lack of data for such an undertaking. McClure et al. [-@mcclure_vulnerability_2023] report the climate vulnerability for several west coast groundfishes, including `r spp`. `r spp` demonstrated both high biological sensitivity and high climate exposure risk, to give it an overall high vulnerability score to climate change. This result should also be considered with the fact that like many rockfishes, periods of low productivity is not unusual to `r spp` and their extended longevity has historically allowed them to wait for advantageous productivity periods. Additional stressors such as fishing and climate change that possibly truncate longevity could bring significant challenges to population sustainability.

## Historical and Current Fishery Information 
`r spp` are harvested by a wide variety of fishing methods including trawling, trolling, and hook-and-line fishing with jigs and longlines.  `r spp` are a major component of the nearshore fixed gear groundfish fishery, known as the "live-fish" fishery, and as incidental catch in the troll fishery for salmon and groundfish. Historically, `r spp` was a common, though more incidental, component of the trawl fishery. With the decline of salmon fishing opportunities in the 1980s and 1990s, `r spp` became a vital target of marine recreational fisheries in Oregon, especially during periods of restricted or slack fishing for salmon, halibut, and tuna.  

Recreational harvest of `r spp` has become the dominant source of removals in Oregon. Since 1990, annual recreational harvests of `r spp` have averaged 301.2 tons off Oregon. Commercial annual harvests by non-trawl gear types during the same period averaged 126.9 mt in Oregon. Harvests by trawl on average during this period have been less than 3 mt annually.

Removal histories have been a significant axis of uncertainty in the past assessments of `r spp`. A major task for the 2007 assessments of `r spp` in was developing a plausible reconstruction of historical landings of `r spp` and exploring the consequences of those landings. A formal commercial catch reconstruction had been recently developed in Oregon [@karnowski_historical_2014] for the 2015 `r spp` assessment, but was subsequently modified to better estimate trawl landings in Oregon and Washington (@cope_assessments_2016). This current assessment also utilizes a recent recreational catch reconstruction (@whitman_oregon_2023). 

## Summary of Management History and Performance - Ali start with this section.
Prior to 2000 the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC or Council) managed the fishery for `r spp` as part of the Sebastes complex, with no separate Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) or Optimum Yield (OY) for `r spp`.  In 2000 the Council established an ABC of 1,200 mt for `r spp` caught north of Cape Mendocino (in the Eureka, Columbia, and Vancouver INPFC statistical areas), but left `r spp` south of Cape Mendocino as part of the "other rockfish" category.  For 2001 through 2003 the ABC for `r spp` caught north of Cape Mendocino was 1,115 mt annually, and `r spp` south of Cape Mendocino remained part of the "other rockfish" category and without a separate ABC or OY.

Regulation of the `r spp` fisheries by the PFMC prior to 2004 was accomplished primarily by trip limits for commercial fisheries and bag limit restrictions for recreational fisheries, with different limits applying in different geographic regions (see Table 1 in @ralston_status_2003).  Some other important regulations include the following.

* 1953: California prohibited trawling within three miles of shore.
* 1995: The commercial hook-and-line fishing in Washington state waters (0-3 miles) was closed to preserve recreational fishing opportunities and avoid localized depletion; the closure was extended to trawlers in 1999.  Oregon established `r spp` management areas with reduced daily commercial fishery trip limits in area near ports with large recreational fisheries.
* 2000: `r spp` began to be managed by the Council as a minor nearshore species.  Commercial trip limits were significantly reduced, with specific restrictions applying to `r spp`.  California instituted seasonal closures for commercial and recreational fisheries inside 20 fathoms, reduced the bag limit for rockfish from 15 to 10 fish, and limited recreational gear to one line with three hooks.
* 2002: California adopted a Nearshore Fishery Management Plan and began more active management of nearshore fisheries including the use of seasonal, regional, and depth-specific closures.  Oregon adopted an Interim Nearshore Fishery Management Plan in anticipation of increased pressure on nearshore stocks due to reduced fishing opportunities for groundfish in federal waters.  Regulations included fishing-sector specific caps on retained harvests, set approximately at the levels attained in 2000.
* 2003: The Council established Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs) to control catches of overfished rockfish species, and large portions of the shelf were closed to fishing.  Differential trip limits were applied north and south of a management boundary at 40\textdegree10' N. latitude for nearshore Sebastes species. Nearshore permittees in California became subject to depth restrictions consistent with the shoreward non-trawl RCA boundary.  In California the commercial and recreational fisheries for rockfish were closed early.
* In 2004 and 2005: the sport fishery in Oregon closed in September 2004 due to early attainment of the state's limit for sport-caught `r spp`.  This was the first time that the sport rockfish fishery in Oregon had not been open all year.  In 2005 it closed early again.
* In 2008 the groundfish trawl fishery was closed in Washington from the seaward RCA boundary to the shore north of 48\textdegree10' N. latitude to address increased encounters with yelloweye rockfish and canary rockfish.

In recent years California, Oregon and Washington regulations for the marine sport fisheries, which has been the major source of mortality on `r spp`, have become quite complicated and variable through time.  Tools for regulating the sport fishery include closed areas, depth restrictions, seasonal closures, and bag limits.

California had no recreational bag limit for rockfish until 1990 when a 15 fish per day per angler limit was implemented.  In 2000 the limit was reduced to 10 fish per day for each angler's combined bag of rockfish, cabezon and greenling.  The fishing season was year-round prior to 2000 and since then has been variable by state management area.  There were no gear restrictions prior to 2000.  In 2000 anglers were limited to fishing one line with three hooks.  Since 2001 they have been restricted to one line with two hooks.  There is no minimum size limit for `r spp`.

Oregon had no recreational bag limits for marine fishes until 1976 when the state established a 25-fish limit.  In 1978 the state established a daily limit of 15 fish for each angler's combined bag of rockfish, cabezon and greenling, which stayed in effect until 1994 when the state established a 10-fish-per-angler daily bag limit specifically for `r spp`.  Following the early closure of the fishing season for `r spp` in 2004, the daily bag limit for `r spp` was dropped to 5 fish at the start of 2005 but was increased in-season to 6 fish.  The per-angler daily bag limit was 6 fish during 2006 and 2007, 5 fish at the start of 2008 and increased in-season to 6 fish, 6 fish at the start of 2009 and increased in-season to 7 fish where it has remained since.  

The goal of Oregon's sport fishery management is to maintain year-round fishing opportunities.  In-season adjustments to regulations can be made more restrictive or less restrictive, depending on circumstances and the prospects for early attainment of harvest caps.  Seasonal depth restrictions (e.g., inside 30 fathoms April 1 to September 30) are one tool used regularly in recent years to control the fishery, driven largely by the need to avoid bycatch of the primary rebuilding species, canary rockfish and yelloweye rockfish.

Washington had a recreational daily bag limit for rockfish (all species) of 15 fish per day from 1961 to 1991, 12 fish per day from 1992 to 1994, and 10 fish per day from 1995 to 2015.  The bag limit for blue rockfish plus `r spp` in Marine Area 4B (Neah Bay) has been 6 fish per day since 2010.  Fishing seasons for groundfish species are structured to provide year-round fishing opportunities, if possible.  Depth restrictions vary by state management area, being more restrictive in the north compared to the south due to higher encounter rates with overfished yelloweye rockfish and canary rockfish.  There is no minimum size limit for `r spp`.

In 2004 the coastwide ABC established for `r spp` was based on the projected yields derived from separate northern [wallace_status_1999] and southern [ralston_status_2003] stock assessments (Table 1). The northern assessment covered the Washington coast and the northernmost portion of Oregon, from Cape Falcon to the WA/OR border at the Columbia River.  The southern assessment covered the entire Oregon coast and the California coastline north of Point Arena.  

To account for the spatial overlap of the two assessment areas, 12% of the projected yield from the northern assessment was transferred to the southern region when deriving the coastwide ABC and OY values of 1,315 mt for 2004.  State-by-state harvest guidelines were established: 326 mt for California, 450 mt for Oregon, and 540 mt for Washington.  A similar approach was taken in 2005 and 2006 and the OY for the area south of the Columbia River was apportioned to harvest guidelines for California and Oregon based on a 42:58 split.  The basis for this apportionment is unclear was to support separate harvest guidelines for each state. The catches were apportioned by the average catch share by state in the 1985-2002 period [@pfmc_abc_2004]. 

In all years when there has been an OY specified for `r spp` the estimated catch has been less than the OY, except for 2003 when the estimated coastwide catch exceeded the ABC for north of Cape Mendocino.  In 2003 the estimated coastwide catch exceeded the OY by 183 mt for the region north of Cape Mendocino, but 290 mt of this coastwide catch was recreational harvest taken south of Cape Mendocino.

## Canadian and Alaska fisheries
`r spp` is a "Non-Quota" species in the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Management Plan, and is not formally assessed in nearshore Canada waters [@dfo_fmp_2014].
