\caption{\label{tab:RetroMohnsrho}The magnitude of retrospective pattern (Mohn's rho; Mohn, 1999) given the removal of ten years of data for fishing intensity (\emph{F}), fraction unfished (Figure \ref{fig:retro-depl}),  recruitment, and spawning stock biomass (\emph{SSB}; Figure \ref{fig:retro-ssb}). Columns are a derivation of Mohn's rho (Hurtado-Ferro et al. 2015) used by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), as originally described in Mohn (1999), and a derivation of Mohn's rho (Woods Hole Mohn's rho; Legault 2009) used by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC).}\\
