#### Tagging Study Estimates of Abundance off Newport, OR, 2002 to 2013

In a study that started in 2002 and concluded in 2014, the ODFW used Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags to mark 2,500 to 4,000 black rockfish annually off Newport, OR.  Marked fish are recovered from recreational fishery landings, with sampling focused on the charter vessel fleet.  Approximately 80% of the annual landings are sampled for marked fish, resulting in the recovery of 3,263 marked fish to date.  

The multi-stage mark-recovery model used to estimate annual survival and recovery rates for the black rockfish population off Newport was similar to "Model 0", as described in Brownie et al. (1985), except that the recovery  rates after the initial year at liberty were held constant (Table 38).  This particular tagging model configuration was selected because it provided a better AIC score than other models that were evaluated.  It allows direct (first-year) recovery rates to differ from recovery rates of previously marked cohorts, which appeared to be the case in the black rockfish mark-recovery data.  Model 0 parameters were then used to calculate annual exploitation rates, which were then applied to the annual landings to estimate annual abundance.

Details for the tagging study are available in Buell and Hannah [-@buell_hannah_2007], which is included as Appendix E to this assessment.  During the 13 years of the study the following minor changes occurred in the study's protocols.  It seems unlikely that these would have had any large effect on the consistency of the results.

* The PIT tags used changed twice as manufacturers introduced updated products.  Specifications listed in the document (Hz and size) did not change and we verified detection rates (always near 100%) each time.
* The report in Appendix E lists week 11(mid-March) as the earliest that annual tagging effort commenced.  In the later years this was as early as week 8 (mid-February) but more often the tagging season did not begin until March.
* There was one tagging trip in July in 2007, but this was excluded from the analysis.
* The definition of the "recovery period" for the analysis was changed from week 26 (year_1) through week 25 (year 2) to July 1 (year 1) through June 30 (year 2).  This results in a shift of 5 to 12 days for when the recovery period is considered to have started.  While this is a minor difference, it accounts for the differences in the recovery matrix shown in AppendixE versus the one in Table 38.

The method for deriving the estimates of annual abundance and their corresponding standard errors differs slightly from what is described in Appendix E.  The basic approach is to estimate the numbers of fish from the equation Ny= Cy/uy, where Cy is the catch (in numbers of fish) in year_y, Ny is the population abundance at the start of the year, and uy is the exploitation rate.  As described in Appendix E, uy can be estimated from the ratio of the estimated recovery rate ((f_y )?) times Cy divided by the number of fish sampled for marks (csy).  The Cy appearing in the numerator of the equation for Ny cancels with the Cy in the numerator of the equation for (u_y )?, leaving as the following estimator for  (N_y )?=?cs?_y?(u_y )?.  Note that csyis the number of fish checked for marks, which is known without error in this study.  Approximate estimates of variance for the (N_y )? values were derived from the delta method.
var[(N_y )? ]?[(?cs?_y )^2?((f_y )? )^4 ]*var[(f_y )? ]


##### Spatial Coverage of the Oregon Tagging Study off Newport

One feature of the Oregon assessment model that is somewhat unique is the use of a prior probability distribution for the catchability parameter associated with the tagging study estimates of abundance of exploitable black rockfish off Newport.  Based on estimates of habitat area by port coupled with port-specific estimates of black rockfish densities, a lognormal prior distribution was developed for the tagging study catchability coefficient (Tag-Q).  The prior developed for the July STAR and subsequent Mop-up STAR was based on catch-per-unit-effort data (CPUE, catch numbers per angler-fishing-hour) from the MRFSS sampling program for the years 1980 to 2003.  The Mop-up STAR Panel requested that the prior distribution be revised using CPUE data that were more contemporaneous with the tagging study.  A revised prior distribution was developed based on CPUE data from the ORBS sampling program for the period 2001 to 2014.  The analysis of habitat area coupled with CPUE fish densities indicates that on average 12.7% of the exploitable portion of the black rockfish population off Oregon reside in the waters off Newport (Table 39).  The lognormal prior distribution (Figure 96) was assumed to have a standard deviation of 0.5, which is more than double the between-port variability calculated from the available CPUE data (CV=0.157).  Although trip-level variability in CPUE is typically much larger than 50%, most of the variation in CPUE is due to variability in catchability rather variability in the abundance of the fish.


#### Nearshore acoustic-visual survey 

Oregon conducted the first statewide combined acoustic-visual survey of nearshore semi-pelagic rockfish in 2021 [@Rasmuson_etal_SSC_2022]. Early analysis and design of the survey is presented in Rasmuson et al. [-@Rasmuson_etl_untrawlable_2022] and Rasmuson et al. [-@Rasmuson_etl_hydrovideo_2022] where perhaps the most important finding was that the population estimate from an early test of the combined acoustic-visual survey was similar to the Black Rockfish pit tagging project’s population estimate [@Krutzikowksy_etal_2019]

The survey was a systematic sampling layout with parallel transects. Parallel (perpendicular to the north south axis) transects were evenly spaced from the Washington border to the California border. “full” transects were spaced every 15 km extending from the 80 m contour to the 0 m contour, and “rock” transects spaced every 1 km where “hard” bottom habitat existed. The length of each rock transect was equal to the east-to west length of the hard habitat plus a 0.5 km buffer applied around the hard habitat. 

The primary survey vessel was the RV Pacific Surveyor, a 17 m retired commercial fishing vessel converted for research purposes. The secondary vessel, used for shallow water applications, was the RV Arima, a 4.9 m recreational fishing vessel converted for nearshore research in depths shallower than the primary vessel could achieve. Acoustic data were collected using two downward-facing, pole-mounted transducers (BioSonics DT-X split beam Scientific Echosounders: 38 and 201 kHz). Acoustic data were informed using video collected with the Benthically Anchored Suspended Stereo Camera (BASSCam). Video deployment locations were selected in situ by the scientist monitoring the acoustic data in real-time. Twice daily hook and line sampling was also conducted. 

An [Online Map](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?webmap=49e8f3a8079448c29a21d4384d2b50dd) of our survey is available showing locations of all sampling events. A total of 595 acoustic transects were conducted and paired with 496 video drops and 48 fishing stations. A total of 35,839 fish were identified in the video and 869 fish captured using hook and line. Lengths for conversion the target-strength length conversion were generated from an aggregate of all video data from the survey. Video drops conducted >50 m from acoustically observed fish were used to predict how many fish were missed by the acoustics. Fish counts were converted to biomass using the length-weight relationship from the hook and line data.

Acoustic data were analyzed using both echo integration and echo counting. Echo integration conversions were done using a combination of target strength length relationships from the literature at the suggestion of the SSC. Acoustic data within 1 m of the bottom (deadzone) were corrected with data from above the deadzone). Schools of fish were observed over rocky habitats at all of the major nearshore reefs. Additional small patch reefs were also observed interspersed throughout the survey area.

A simple design-based population estimate was generated by averaging the density of the acoustics in each habitat type (rock, gravel and sand) and multiplying it by the total area of each of those habitat types from the Washington border to the California border.

Extensive hypoxia was encountered on the survey from the Washington border to approximately Heceta Head. Although this appeared to affect fish behavior and distribution, data were treated as though there was no affect.
