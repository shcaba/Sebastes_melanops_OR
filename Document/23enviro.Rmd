## Data Considered but Not Included
  
  Special projects data for `r spp` were reviewed but ultimately, with the large number of commercial and recreational samples available under standard sampling protocols, these data were not used in the reference model. There were also multiple sources of fishery-independent information that ODFW has provided to assessments in recent years as ancillary data that were considered. These included ROV survey data, video lander survey data and the Marine Reserves longline survey data. ODFW ROV data were reviewed by an SSC methodology review in 2020 (see PFMC September 2020 briefing book; Agenda Item D.4 Attachment 1) and used to independently estimate population size for Quillback Rockfish in Oregon (@langseth_status_2021). Video lander data from multiple projects was recertly summarized by Marine Resources Program staff (@rasmuson_nine_2020). These data were used to develop density estimates and independent abudance estimates for the most recent assessments for both Quillback Rockfish (@langseth_status_2021) and Lingcod (@taylor_status_2021). These two datasets were not included, as they were not designed specifically to survey `r spp` and the ODFW Nearshore Acoustic-Visual survey was regarded as a stronger estimate of the scale of the `r spp` population scale without the major caveats that come with using the ROV or lander data. Finally, the Marine Reserves longline survey data collected in Oregon's marine reserves were available from 2015 - 2019. While `r spp` are encountered in this survey, samples sizes are lower than the Hook and Line survey and the gear type is not ideal for `r spp`.
