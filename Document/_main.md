# Executive summary{-}

## Stock{-}

This assessment reports the status of Black Rockfish (_Scientific name_) off the US West coast using data through xxxx.
The assessments described in this document apply to the black rockfish (Sebastes melanops) stocks that reside in the waters from Point Conception (34\textdegree27' N latitude) in the south to the U.S. boundary with Canada (approximately 48\textdegree30' N latitude).  Following the consensus recommendations from a preliminary stock assessment workshop in April 2015 (PFMC 2015), the stock assessment team (STAT) decided to prepare separate geographic stock assessments that are spatially stratified with boundaries at the CA/OR border (42\textdegree00' N latitude) and OR/WA border (46\textdegree16' N latitude).  

Black rockfish are also caught from the waters off British Columbia and Alaska, but there have not been any formal assessments of stock status for those areas.

## Catches{-}

Black rockfish are caught by a wide variety of gear types and in recent decades have been a very important target species for recreational charter-boats and private sport anglers in Washington and Oregon, and to a lesser extent in California.  In recent years the recreational fishery has accounted for most of the black rockfish catches (Figure ES-1 to Figure ES-3).  Black rockfish can also be an important component of nearshore commercial fisheries, either as incidental catch by the troll fishery for salmon or as directed catch by jig fisheries for groundfish.  Further, in California and Oregon there are nearshore fisheries that catch and sell fish live for the restaurant trade.  Washington closed nearshore commercial fisheries in state water in late 1990s and never allowed the live-fish fishery to develop. In all states there have been almost no trawl-caught landings of black rockfish in recent years (Table ES-1), but trawl landings in the past were substantial (Figure ES-1 to Figure ES-3).

Detailed reports of commercial landings of black rockfish are generally unavailable prior to 1981, when the Pacific Fishery Information Network (PacFIN) database began.  The catch series prior to 1981 for these assessments were derived by applying available estimates or assumed values for the proportion of black rockfish landings in reported landings of rockfish.  Observer data, which are available only for the past decade, indicate low levels of discarding of black rockfish, generally less than 2% of total catch.

Because of their nearshore distribution and low abundance compared to other rockfish species, black rockfish are unlikely to have ever comprised a large percentage of rockfish landings, but it seems quite certain that they have been more than a trivial component for many years.  Black rockfish were one of only four rockfish species mentioned by scientific name in reports of rockfish landings in Oregon during the 1940s, and they were one of only six rockfish species mentioned by scientific name in reports of rockfish landings in California during the same period. Mentions of black rockfish extend back before the year 1900 in Washington.

## Data and assessment{-}

The last stock assessments for black rockfish were conducted in 2007 for areas north and south of Cape Falcon (45\textdegree46' North latitude). The current assessments assume three areas instead of two, delineated by the state lines as was agreed upon at a pre-assessment and data workshop in March 2015. The prior assessments used Stock Synthesis 2, while the current assessments use Stock Synthesis 3. The Washington base assessment includes a dockside and tag-based CPUE series, but does not include the abundance estimate time series from that same tagging study which was included in the last assessment due to too many violations in the assumptions of abundance estimation. The same two commercial and single recreational fleets are used as in the last assessment for Washington. The Oregon assessment has three commercial fleets and two recreational fleets, while using five surveys and an additional research study for biological compositions. California also has three commercial fleets and 1 recreational fleet with three surveys of abundance, all based on recreational fisheries. All area models include age data as conditional age at lengths. Length compositions are also included in all models.

This assessment uses the stock assessment framework
Stock Synthesis 

(SS3).

# Data

Data comprise the foundational components of stock assessment models.
The decision to include or exclude particular data sources in an assessment model depends on many factors.
These factors often include, but are not limited to,
the way in which data were collected (e.g., measurement method and consistency);
the spatial and temporal coverage of the data;
the quantity of data available per desired sampling unit;
the representativeness of the data to inform the modeled processes of importance;
timing of when the data were provided;
limitations imposed by the Terms of Reference; and
the presence of an avenue for the inclusion of the data in the assessment model.
Attributes associated with a data source can change through time,
as can the applicability of the data source when different modeling approaches are explored (e.g., stock structure or time-varying processes).
Therefore, the specific data sources included or excluded from this assessment should not necessarily constrain the selection of data sources applicable to future stock assessments for Black Rockfish.
Even if a data source is not directly used in the stock assessment they can provide valuable insights into biology, fishery behavior, or localized dynamics.

Data from a wide range of programs were available for possible inclusion in the current assessment model.
Descriptions of each data source included in the model (Figure \@ref(fig:data-plot)) and sources that were explored but not included in the base model are provided below.
Data that were excluded from the base model were explicitly explored during the development of this stock assessment or have not changed since their past exploration in a previous Black Rockfish stock assessment.
In some cases, the inclusion of excluded data sources were explored through sensitivity analyses (see Section \@ref(assessment-model)).

<!--chapter:end:21f-.Rmd-->

## Fishery-Independent Data

<!--chapter:end:21s-.Rmd-->

### \acrlong{s-aslope}

The \gls{s-aslope} operated during the months of October to November aboard the R/V _Miller Freeman_.
Partial survey coverage of the US west coast occurred during the years 1988-1996 and complete coverage (north of 34\textdegree 30\textquotesingle S) during the years 1997 and 1999-2001.
Typically, only these four years that are seen as complete surveys are included in assessments.

<!--chapter:end:21s-aslope.Rmd-->

### \acrlong{s-ccfrp}

Since 2007, the \gls{s-ccfrp} has monitored several areas in California to evaluate the performance of \glspl{mpa}
and understand nearshore fish populations
[@Wendt2009; @Starr2015].
In 2017, the survey expanded beyond the four \Gls{mpa}s in central California
(A&ntilde;o Nuevo, Point Lobos, Point Buchon, and Piedras Blancas)
to include the entire California coast.
Fish are collected by volunteer anglers aboard \glspl{cpfv} guided by one of the following academic institutions based on proximity to fishing location:
Humboldt State University;
Bodega Marine Laboratories;
Moss Landing Marine Laboratories;
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo;
University of California, Santa Barbara; and
Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

Surveys consist of fishing with hook-and-line gear for 30-45 minutes within randomly chosen 500 by 500 m grid cells within and outside \glspl{mpa}.
Prior to 2017, all fish were measured for length and release or descended to depth;
since then, some were sampled for otoliths and fin clips.


<!--chapter:end:21s-ccfrp.Rmd-->

### \acrlong{s-tri}

The \gls{s-tri} was first conducted by the \gls{afsc} in 1977, and the survey continued until 2004 [@weinberg_2001_2002].
Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced east-to-west transects across the continential shelf from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated.
The survey design changed slightly over time.
In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid summer through early fall.
The 1977 survey was conducted from early July through late September.
The surveys from 1980 through 1989 were conducted from mid-July to late September.
The 1992 survey was conducted from mid July through early October.
The 1995 survey was conducted from early June through late August.
The 1998 survey was conducted from early June through early August.
Finally, the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted from May to July.

Haul depths ranged from 91-457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls shallower than 91 m.
Due to haul performance issues and truncated sampling with respect to depth, the data from 1977 were omitted from this analysis.
The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the US West Coast south to 36.8\textdegree N latitude and a depth range of 55-366 m.
The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the southern range to 34.5\textdegree N (near Point Conception).
From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range 55-500 m and surveyed south to 34.5\textdegree N.
In 2004, the final year of the \gls{s-tri} series, the \gls{nwfsc} \gls{fram} conducted the survey following similar protocols to earlier years.

<!--chapter:end:21s-tri.RMd-->

### \acrlong{s-wcgbt}

The \Gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design;
covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011].
This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two 'passes' of the coast.
Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October.
This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability,
as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.
