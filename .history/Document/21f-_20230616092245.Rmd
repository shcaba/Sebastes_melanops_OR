## Removals

### Commercial Landings and Discards

Commercial landings and discards by fleet are shown in Table \ref{tab:catch_history}.

#### Background 

The previous `r spp` assessment (@cope_assessments_2016) used a number of sources of information to most accurately compile commercial catches of `r spp`. A comprehensive historical commercial catch reconstruction (@karnowski_historical_2014) had just been completed prior to the 2015 `r spp` assessment that provided gear-specific landings starting in 1892, but ODFW staff noted high year to year variability and unreasonably high magnitude in `r spp` trawl landings, primarily from the port of Astoria on the northern border with Washington and during the early years of the development of the trawl fishery (approximately 1940s – 1980s).  Further, the Karnowski reconstruction did not account for fish captured outside of Oregon waters but landed in Oregon, as is the case with the majority of trawl landings for `r spp` in Astoria. As an alternative to the Karnowski reconstruction, ODFW reconstructed rockfish trawl landings in PFMC Area 3A, which includes both Oregon and Washington fishing grounds. These rockfish category landings utilized data sources with finer spatial delineation to separate landings among PFMC areas in Oregon than were used in the comprehensive reconstruction (@karnowski_historical_2014). These include: FSUS reports for the Columbia River district (1940 – 1955), PFMC reports for Area 3A (1956 – 1977), ODFW estimated Astoria trawl landings documented in ODFW Marine Program data series report (@douglas_species_1998; 1978 – 1982) and ODFW landing receipts from Astoria (1983 – 1986).  To separate `r spp` from rockfish market category landings in 3A, an aggregated proportion of `r spp` were used from trawl-specific species compositions available in @douglas_species_1998. From 1940 to 1975, an aggregated proportion from 1963 – 1975 was applied to rockfish landings (14.1%) and for 1976 – 1986, an aggregated proportion from 1976 – 1986 was used (6.8%). Finally, `r spp` in 3A were apportioned north and south of the OR-WA border using ODFW species composition data that provide the state area of the catch. This resulted in 98.6% of 3A `r spp` apportioned to WA during 1940 – 1986 in the previous assessment. 

#### Current Methodology: Trawl Landings (1892 - 2022)

While the above methodology was acceptable for the 2015 `r spp` assessment, there was a desire for a more equitable approach between Oregon and Washington for the current assessment. To that end, ODFW provided reconstructed 3A rockfish category landings to WDFW staff that were apportioned north and south of the OR-WA border using the above methodology for 1940 - 1986. This allowed each state to utilize a separate approach to delineate `r spp`-specific landings. 

For Oregon-specific trawl 3A landings, the previous aggregated proportion of `r spp` were applied to the apportioned 3A rockfish landings (14.1% for 1940 – 1975 and 6.8% from 1976 – 1986). There are no other sources of information on historic trawl rockfish compositions and aggregating data across years increases available samples, though it does assume that compositions do not vary widely across time. This approach best utilizes the available species composition data from this time period. These 3A `r spp` landings were added to the reconstructed landings using an identical methodology for the other Oregon PFMC areas (2A, 2B and 2C) developed for the previous assessment for the complete trawl landings during the historical time period. 

Trawl landings for `r spp` from 1892 – 1939 and from 1987 forward were not included in the reconstruction for the previous assessment. These values are available from the Karnowski reconstruction (@karnowski_historical_2014) for 1892 – 1939 and are identical to those used in the 2015 assessment. From 1987 - 2022, landings for `r spp` were obtained from PacFIN (accessed March 9, 2023). In addition to PacFIN landings, ODFW also reconstructed the URCK and POP categories in PacFIN from 1987 – 1999 (@noauthor_oregon_2017). This reconstruction was not available for the previous assessment. 

#### Current Methodology: Non-Trawl Landings (1892 - 2022)

Non-trawl landings were provided by ODFW and by PacFIN, depending on the time period. Non-trawl landings from 1892 – 1986 era available from the Karnowski reconstruction (@karnowski_historical_2014) and are identical to the 2015 assessment. Again, a combination of ODFW’s URCK/POP reconstruction (@noauthor_oregon_2017) and PacFIN landings were used to estimate landings from 1987 – 1999. From 2000 – 2022, PacFIN landings were used exclusively. 

#### Commercial discards

The West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) has monitored discards and landings coastwide to provide total catch mortality by species or species group since 2002. WCGOP estimates of `r spp` discards from 2002 - 2021 were used in this assessment to account for commercial discard mortality (obtained March 30, 2023). Fleet-specific rates were obtained by averaging the annual rate of discarded fish to the total mortality and this rate was applied to annual estimates of catch for each fleet. Trawl discard rates averaged 4.1% but were highly variable during this time period. Non-trawl discard rates averaged 0.9%. 

#### Foreign Fishery Catches of Black Rockfish

Rogers [-@rogers_species_2003] developed catch reconstructions for removals by foreign trawlers operating off the U.S. West Coast during the late 1960s to mid-1970s. Although this study reports that Japanese vessels operating in the Columbia and Eureka statistical areas (Oregon and northern California) caught substantial amounts of `r spp`, with cumulative catches of more than 500 mt over 10 years, it seems very unlikely that foreign vessels could have operated sufficiently close to shore to catch appreciable amounts of `r spp`. This assessment does not include Rogers' estimates of foreign fleet removals of `r spp`, nor was it included in the previous assessment (@cope_assessments_2016). 


### Recreational Landings and Discards

Recreational landings and discards by fleet are shown in Table \ref{tab:catch_history}. Comparisons of the catch in each recreational fishery for the current and previous assessments are in Figure \ref{fig:catch-bridge}.

#### Historic Ocean Boat Landings and Discards (1973 - 2000)

Recently, ODFW undertook an effort to comprehensively reconstruct all marine fish recreational ocean boat landings prior to 2001 (@whitman_oregon_2023). Reconstructed catch estimates from the Oregon Recreational Boat Survey (ORBS) improve upon estimates from the federal Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistical Survey (MRFSS), which have known biases related to effort estimation and sampling (@van_voorhees_etal_2000) that resulted in catch estimates considered implausible by ODFW.  However, the ORBS sample estimates are known to lack the comprehensive spatial and temporal coverage of MRFSS. Addressing this coverage issue is a major part of this reconstruction. In general, the base data and methodology for these reconstructed estimates are consistent with recent assessments for other nearshore species (@cope_status_2021; @langseth_status_2021; @taylor_status_2021; @wetzel_status_2021).  

Prior to 2001, ORBS monitored marine species in both multi-species categories, such as rockfish, flatfish, and other miscellaneous fishes, and as individual species, such as lingcod or halibut.  For this comprehensive reconstruction, four species categories were selected to reconstruct, including rockfish, lingcod, flatfish and miscellaneous, which constitute the bulk of the managed marine fish species. `r spp` are a component of the rockfish species category.  

Category-level estimates were expanded to account for gaps in sampling coverage in two separate pathways. First, estimates from five major ports were expanded to include unsampled winter months in years lacking complete coverage.  Expansions were based on available year-round sampling data and excluded years where regulations may have impacted the temporal distribution of catch.  Second, all other minor port estimates were expanded to include seasonal estimates in years lacking any sampling based on the amount of minor port catch as compared to all major port estimates.  A subset of landings were sampled by ORBS for species compositions within these categories. Once category-level landings were comprehensive in space and time, species compositions were applied for the three multi-species categories, including rockfish, flatfish and miscellaneous fish. Borrowing rules for species compositions were specific to the category and determined based on a series of regression tree analyses that detailed the importance of each domain (year, month, port and fishing mode) to variability in compositions.  

Ocean boat estimates from 1979 – 2000 in numbers of fish of `r spp` from the above described methods were converted to biomass using biological samples from MRFSS.  MRFSS biological data are available from 1980 – 1989 and 1993 – 2000. An annual average weight was applied to the total annual number of fish to obtain an annual biomass estimate of the landings. Several years missing biological data (1979, 1990 – 1992) were filled in using neighboring years or interpolation. MRFSS biological data were filtered for direct measured samples only. These landings in biomass were provided by ODFW and do not include an estimate of discarded fish. Landings during this time period average 309.9 mt and are of similar magnitude to the previous assessment (@cope_assessments_2016). Landings from 1973 to 1978 were initiated at zero in 1973 and ramped up to the initial biomass estimate from 1979. Bag limits in the recreational fishery during this time period (prior to 2001) are generally liberal and ODFW staff recommended that no additional mortality of discarded fish be included from 1973 - 2000. 

#### Modern Ocean Boat Landings and Discards (2001 - 2022) 

Recreational landings for ocean boat modes from 2001 – 2022 are available from RecFIN (accessed March 25, 2023). Both retained and discarded (released) estimates of mortality are included, though retained mortality contributes the vast majority to total mortality.  Release mortality is estimated from angler-reported release rates and the application of discard mortality rates from the PFMC. The average proportion of `r spp` discarded was 0.92% from 2001 – 2022. From 2001 – 2022, total landings averaged 307.6mt, ranging from 198.7 to 458.6 mt. In 2022, estimated ocean boat landings were 374.3 mt. 

#### Shore and Estuary Boat Landings (1892 - 2022) 

ODFW provided reconstructed estimates of shore and estuary landings for black rockfish from 1892 – 2022, using methodology similar to recent assessments (@langseth_status_2021; @taylor_status_2021; @wetzel_status_2021). Data sources include MRFSS and the Oregon Shore and Estuary Boat Survey (SEBS). Numbers of fish were provided by MRFSS from 1980 – 1989 and 1993 – June 2003, and by SEBS from July 2003 – June 2005.  An annual mode-specific average weight was applied to numbers of `r spp` from 1980 – 1989 and 1993 – 2005.  Separate weights were calculated for shore and estuary boat modes, and excluded extreme outliers and imputed values.  This reconstruction also applied two scaling factors to remove bias towards freshwater sampling and underestimation of estuary boats, as detailed in [-@dick_combined_2018]. To estimate `r spp` landings from July – December 2005, an expansion was developed using the three year average of the ratio between the first six months of the year and the total annual landings from MRFSS and SEBS landings from 2002 - 2004.  Separate expansions were developed for shore mode and estuary boat modes.  

Unlike the ocean boat recreational fishery, which developed during the 1970s, it was assumed that some shore and estuary fishing for `r spp` has occurred for many decades. As a result, the previous `r spp` assessment used fishing licenses to scale shore and estuary landings (@cope_assessments_2016). However, the link of `r spp` landings to fishing license sales is not well supported (pers. comm. A. Whitman, ODFW) and this assessment assumes a simple linear ramp from zero catch in 1892 to the estimated shore/estuary biomass of 28.1 mt in 1980, which produces a similar trajectory in catches to the previous assessment. Additionally, the ODFW does not currently sample shore and estuary boat fishing trips, and so a ten year average landing (1996 – 2005; 13.3 mt/year) was used to estimate shore and estuary boat landings during 2006 – 2022. Again, this methodology differed from the previous assessment and did not use fishing license sales to scale the removals but still produces a similar trajectory and magnitude of removals as the 2015 assessment shore/estuary removals. Shore and estuary boat landings for `r spp` are minor compared to recreational ocean boat removals but consistent. Shore and estuary boat landings average 17.2 mt annually from 1980 – 2003.  To obtain an estimate of discarded fish for the shore and estuary fleet, the ocean boat proportion of discarded fish from RecFIN (0.92%; 2001 – 2022) was applied to the estimated shore and estuary landings during 2001 – 2022. As with the ocean boat fleet, discard mortality was not estimated for shore and estuary landings prior to 2001, as bag limits were relatively high and discarding was assumed to be very limited. 

As described above, recreational discard mortality for the ocean boat fleet was included from RecFIN from 2001 - 2022. Based on these landings data, an average discard rate of 0.92% was applied to the shore and estuary boat fleet to account for discarded fish from 2001 - 2022. No recreational discards were accounted for prior to 2001, based on ODFW recommendation that bag limits for `r spp` were high and discards were likely extremely low. There are no data that can speak to discard rates in the recreational fishery prior to 2001. 

## Length and Age Composition Data

Fish length measurements, from both the commercial and recreational fisheries, are one of the major sources of data for this assessment. Length composition data from the commercial and recreational fisheries in Oregon were included, as were age composition data from the commercial and recreational fisheries in Oregon. ODFW Port Biologists collect biological data and samples from commercial fisheries coastwide. These data are available from PacFIN (23 March, 2023) and were processed using the PacFIN Utilities package (https://github.com/pfmc-assessments/PacFIN.Utilities). The vast majority of commercial biological data are gender-specific. 

The input sample sizes for all commercial data initially were calculated based on a combination of trips and fish sampled:

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}

For the recreational fleets, prior to 2001, the length composition data are from the MRFSS, which was a federally funded program operating beginning in 1980 that collects information on the marine sport fisheries. The MRFSS program includes an intercept survey in which sport anglers are interviewed as they return from fishing trips, and where samplers can identify and measure the retained catches. The MRFSS sampling is intended to cover all forms of marine recreational fishing, including shore-based activities from beaches, jetties, and piers.  In contrast the ORBS program that operates only in Oregon interviews and samples anglers operating from boats. The MRFSS length data, which are housed in the RecFIN database, generally do not indicate the sex of individual fish that were measured. In 2001, MRFSS was discontinued and ORBS became the primary source of recreational marine biological data. Similarly, the length data collected by the ORBS program does not generally indicate gender. All recreational biological data are available on RecFIN (accessed March 25, 2023). 

### Length Compositions

The length data for the assessment model were tabulated into 2-cm length bins ranging from 10 cm to 64 cm, with accumulator bins at each end. 

The length composition data indicate some general differences among the fleets, with the trawl fisheries producing the largest fish, the ocean boat recreational fishery and the non-trawl fisheries producing fish of intermediate length and the shore fleet producing the smallest fish. There is little evidence in any of the length composition data of distinct modes or successions of modes from one year to the next that might represent strong year-classes.

#### Commercial - JASON - double check this section 

These data are from trawl and non-trawl fisheries from ports south of Astoria. The PacFIN dataset contains records for Oregon landings into Astoria; however, the majority of these samples are believed to have been landed in Washington waters and are used in the Washington model. Length composition data are reported in fork length. These data are expanded to reduce the effect of non-uniform sampling effort. The expansions are by weight, catch/sampled catch; first on a per-trip level, and then on a per-year, per-fishery level.  Expansion factors have a minimum value of 1, and are capped at their 90th percentile value. The final sample size is the product of the two expansion factors, which is then capped at its 90th percentile value. The data were stratified by gender and fishery (Table ??).  The final sample sizes were stratified and summed by length bin (10 cm to 60 64 cm bins, 2 cm in width), and an effective sample size is computed from the number of trips and number of fish each stratum represents, according to the Stewart and Miller method for multinomial fishery data (Table \ref{tab:input_ss_length}) . A small number of unsexed fish were present in the data; as these did not represent a distinct length distribution, they were excluded from the model.

#### Recreational

Recreational length samples were obtained from two primary sources: MRFSS and ORBS (available on RecFIN). ODFW special project sampling data were considered but given the high sample sizes available from standard sampling, these data were not utilized. From 1980 – 1989 and from 1993 – 2000, the MRFSS program collected samples from both ocean and inland (estuary) areas (n = 46,656).  ODFW provided MRFSS samples with the addition of a column that flagged length values imputed from weights to allow for selection of directly measured values (n = 32,130).  From 1980 – 1989, total lengths (mm) were collected by MRFSS, which were converted to fork length.  From 1993 – 2000, fork length (mm) was collected.  Length samples from 2001 – 2022 from the ORBS sampling program are available on RecFIN (n = 197,216).  All ORBS samples are by fork length (mm).  The vast majority (95.5%) of these samples are from ocean trips (n = 188,372). Table \ref{tab:rec_length_samples} details the number of length sizes by year and recreational fleet and Table \ref{tab:input_ss_length} shows the input sample sizes.  

### Age Compositions

The fishery data for the assessment model consisted of otolith age-readings, mostly from the recreational fishery (ADD COMM AGE TABLE; Table \ref{tab:rec_age_samples}). Age composition data were a subset of the length data, 41,212 records in total. The age composition data for the assessment model were tabulated into 1-yr age bins from 1 to 40 years.  For the data tabulation provided in this document, the accumulator bins were extended to compress and simplify display of the data.

The age composition data generally do not show much evidence of distinct year-classes that can be easily tracked from one year to the next, which suggests that that there is not much recruitment variability from year-to-year or that age-reading error is sufficient to mask the appearance of strong year-classes. Age-at-length compositions were not expanded; the final sample sizes were set to 1 before tallying. The ages were modeled as conditional age-at-length.

## Mean weights

Mean weights were used in the previous assessment (@cope_assessments_2016) but not developed for this assessment. 

## Fishery-Dependent Abundance Indices

Age and length composition data by themselves do not provide sufficient information to reliably determine trends in stock abundance and biomass.  Most assessments of U.S. West Coast groundfish stocks rely on estimates of stock biomass from research trawl surveys to provide information on biomass trends, but `r spp` are very infrequently caught in any of the bottom trawl surveys, which have a limited coverage of shallow nearshore waters (none of the surveys have ever been conducted in waters shallower than 55 m). Multiple fishery-dependent indices are available for these assessments that are based on commercial or recreational catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE; Table \ref{tab:survey_summary} and Figure \ref{fig:sur-summ-all}). For the commerical non-trawl fleet, an index of abundance based on retained catch from logbook data from the coastwide live-fish fishery was updated. For the recreational ocean boat fleet, an index of abundance from MRFSS interview level data was developed for the previous assessment (@cope_assessments_2016), covering 1980 - 1989 and 1993 - 2000. A second index from ORBS dockside sampling was updated for this assessment (2001 - 2022). Finally, a third recreational ocean boat index based on the Oregon At-Sea charter observer program was updated for this assessment, but ultimately not used in the reference model. 

### Commercial Index of Abundance - Nearshore Fishery Logbook CPUE

Only one abundance index is available from the Oregon commercial fisheries, one derived from a nearshore logbook CPUE time-series from a fixed gear fleet that operates coastwide. The ODFW has required nearshore commercial fishers (both nearshore permitted vessels and open access vessels) to submit fishing logbooks since 2004. Compliance is generally high, averaging around 80%, but has varied through time ranging from 65% in 2007 to greater than 90% in recent years. Although required to provide all requested information in the logbook per fishing gear set, there has been substantial variation in the quantity and quality of information reported in logbooks. The logbook database contains information on catch by species (number or pounds of retained and released fish), effort (hook hours), sample location (port), date, vessel, fishing depth, fishing gear, fishing permit, number of fishers, and harvest trip limits.

Logbook information went through multiple data quality filters to attain the best possible consistent and representative data set through time to estimate a relative abundance trend. Individual observations of catch and effort were at the trip level, where multi-set trips were aggregated to the trip level. CPUE was calculated for each trip, where total catch was defined as the total of all reported retained catch (in pounds) and total effort was defined by hook-hours (number of hooks used multiplied by the number of hours fished). Previous iterations of this index utilized both released and retained fish; however, released fish were converted to weight by applying a median catch weight. This was deemed an unnecessary uncertainty for a Black Rockfish index, as few boats release substantial amounts of black rockfish. In general, data filters that were applied included eliminating records with missing or unrealistic values, including permitted trips using only hook and line jig gear from ports with appreciable data, and using only vessels that fished in at least three years over the logbook history. Vessel operators may have changed through time as the filter was tied to the vessel name only. Gear type was restricted to hook-and-line only (excluding longline gear) because this gear type accounts for the majority of trips for Black Rockfish (approximately 90.3% of unfiltered dataset). These filters are consistent with the most recent Black Rockfish assessment (@cope_assessments_2016) and, where applicable, other recent assessments that utilize the nearshore logbook index (@cope_assessing_2019; @taylor_status_2021). In the final, filtered dataset, `r spp` are present at a high frequency (Table \ref{tab:percent_pos_NSlog}.

Covariates evaluated included year, month, port, depth, number of people onboard and the two-month Black Rockfish catch limit. A negative binomial model was fit to the trip-level data (catch with a log offset for hook hours). This full model was selected as the best fit model by AIC Table \ref{tab:model_selection_NSlog}. However, when fit via MLE using the sdmTMB R package (version 0.3.0), this model had unacceptably large standard errors for the fixed parameters. Acceptable diagnostics were achieved by excluding the two-month trip limit covariate. The final model included all of the covariates of the full model with the exception of the two-month trip limit. The index of abundance and associated input standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:survey_summary}.

### Oregon Recreational Indices of Abundance

The three recreational fishery abundance indices available for the Oregon regional assessment are summarized in Table \ref{tab:survey_summary} and Figure \ref{fig:sur-summ-all}.  The sections below describe the underlying data and derivations of the indices.

#### MRFSS Dockside CPUE for Oregon, 1980 to 2000

This index was included in the 2015 `r spp` assessment but not updated for this assesment. For the RecFIN data from Oregon, the logistic regression analysis to select likely `r spp` trips was based on data from 6,165 charter-boat trips and a suite of 23 species (excluding `r spp`).  The analysis generally produced large positive coefficients for shallow-water species that one would expect to co-occur with `r spp` (e.g., copper rockfish and blue rockfish), and large negative coefficients for deep-water or pelagic species that one would not expect to co-occur with `r spp` (e.g., Pacific halibut and coho salmon). Those trips having an estimated probability of producing a `r spp` that exceeded the cut-off value of 0.758 were selected for the CPUE analysis.  

This cut-off value was chosen to balance the false-positives against the false-negatives and resulted in some trips that were estimated to be false positives, where `r spp` were caught, but should not have been, given the other species caught during those trips.  These probably represent trips that fished in multiple locations, and thus caught a mix of shallow- and deep-water species. The screening also resulted in the inclusion of trips (false negatives) that should have caught `r spp` (given the other species), but did not.  A total of 5,261 trips were selected for the CPUE analysis.

The MRFSS dockside standardized CPUE index for Oregon (Table \ref{tab:survey_summary}) was developed from the selected subset of the catch and effort data using GLMs, with a binomial model to estimate the probability of catching at least one `r spp` and a gamma model to estimate the magnitude of the positive catches per angler-fishing-hour.  In all cases, the structural models had three main effects for the factors Year, Wave (bimonthly period) and Region (southern versus northern OR), and there were no interaction terms.  

The annual index values were derived as the product of two components: predicted values for the probability of catching a `r spp` during a trip, and predicted values for the number of `r spp` caught by an angler per hour of fishing, given that at least one `r spp` was caught. This CPUE index for Oregon has a high amount of inter-annual variation, particularly in the early part of the time-series. The index shows a fairly steady upward trend starting from 1987.

#### ORBS Dockside CPUE for Oregon, 2001 to 2022

Trip-level catch-per-unit-effort data from ORBS dockside sampling was obtained from ODFW. To mitigate the confounding of hourly effort associated with these trips with travel, the travel time was subtracted from the hours fished. Travel time was stratified by boat type (charter and private) and was calculated as boat type-specific speeds (13 mph for charter boat trips and 18 mph for private boat trips) multiplied by twice the distance between the port of origin and the reef that was fished. CPUE, expressed in terms of fish per angler-hour, was calculated by multiplying the number of anglers and the adjusted travel time. The database contains information on catch by species (number of retained fish), effort (angler hours), sample location (port where data were collected), date, bag limits and other relevant regulations, boat type (charter or private), and trip type (e.g., bottom associated fish). 

The unfiltered data set contained 414,587 trips. Multiple standardized filters are applied to ORBS trip-level data to remove outliers and data unsuitable for an index. These filters include trips with incorrect interview times, which impact calculation of effort, unreasonably long or short trips, and retaining only bottomfish target trips. Further filters were utilized for fishing closures (i.e. temporal or spatial closures) and catches exceeding bag limits, which would presumably impact catch rates. An alternative configuration of the dataset included a binary variable to identify trips that hit the bag limit to include as a covariate, rather than a filtering criterion, and did not filter out trips that had reached the daily bag limit. Trips from several ports with extremely small sample sizes (<1% of total trips) were also excluded and finally, trips that met criteria for irrational effort reporting (i.e., implausible values) or extreme catch rates were excluded as well. The final dataset included 96,707 trips. The previous assessment only included trips onboard charter vessels (@cope_assessments_2016), but this filter was not retained for this updated index. Instead, boat type was evaluated as a covariate. In the final, filtered dataset, `r spp` are present at a high frequency (Table \ref{tab:percent_pos_ORBS}.

Covariates evaluated included year, month, port, the open depths to fishing (all depths or inside 20/30/40fm), boat type and the daily bag limit for `r spp`.  A negative binomial model was fit to the trip-level data (catch with a log offset for adjusted angler hours). This full model was selected as the best fit model by AIC Table \ref{tab:model_selection_ORBS}. However, when fit via MLE using the sdmTMB R package (version 0.3.0), this model did not converge. Acceptable diagnostics were achieved by excluding the bag limit covariate. An additional sdmTMB model was fit that used the alternative configuration of the dataset, and included all of the full model covariates but replaced the bag limit covariate with the binary variable of whether the bag limit was reached on the trip.  While acceptable diagnostics were achieved with the alternative full model, there was little effect on the resultant index and for parsimony, the final model included all of the covariates of the original full model with the exception of the daily bag limit. The index of abundance and associated input standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:survey_summary}. 

#### On-Board Observer CPUE for Oregon, 2001 and 2003 to 2022

Drift-level catch-per-unit-effort data from ORBS at-sea charter observer sampling program was obtained from ODFW. The database contains information on catch by species (number of retained and released fish), effort (angler hours), sample depth, and bag limits and other relevant regulations.  

The unfiltered data set contained 12,344 drifts. Multiple standardized filters are applied to the drift level data to remove outliers and data unsuitable for an index. These filters were co-developed with SWFSC staff (@monk_documentation_2013). These filters include drifts without data needed for CPUE information, long drifts (below 95th quantile), drifts in deeper waters (less than 64fm, 99th quantile), drifts that were targeting primarily mid-water species, and drifts outside of the legal fishing depth (with a five fm buffer). Additionally, drifts with recreational longleader gear were removed, as `r spp` is not a legal longleader species in Oregon, and years with less than 100 samples were also removed. This included 2020 and 2021, during which the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically limited the ability to sample onboard charter vessels. Finally, drifts onboard charters from Port Orford were removed due to small sample sizes. 

Covariates evaluated included year, month (or two-month wave), port, the open depths to fishing (all depths or inside 20/30/40fm), and a 10fm-binned depth of drift covariate.  A negative binomial model was fit to the drift-level data (catch with a log offset for adjusted angler hours). A model without the open fishing depths was selected as the best fit model by AIC Table \ref{tab:model_selection_AtSea}. However, when fit using the sdmTMB R package (version 0.3.0), the QQ plot indicated heavily skewed data and acceptable diagnostics were not achieved for any model explored. As a result, and given an alternative recreational ocean boat index with much larger sample sizes overall (ORBS), this index was not recommended for use in this assessment and subsequently not included in the reference model.
