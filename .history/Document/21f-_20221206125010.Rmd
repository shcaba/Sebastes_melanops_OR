## Fishery-Dependent Data

### Commercial
#### Landings
The systems along the U.S. West Coast for monitoring commercial fishery landings in the past did not keep track of the landings of individual rockfish species, largely because many rockfish species have similar market characteristics and therefore were landed as an unsorted mix of species.  Black rockfish in particular, which are a nearshore species and much less abundant than many of the offshore rockfish species, were generally landed in mixed-species categories.  As a consequence, the historical records do not provide a detailed accounting of the landings of black rockfish.  The basic approach taken to develop the landings series in this assessment (as in past assessments) was to apply values for the proportion of black rockfish sampled in mixed-rockfish landings.  Data on the proportions of black rockfish are sparse, with the consequence that the landings reconstructions are highly uncertain.

All three regional assessments use data for the modern era (for 1981 to 2014) from the Pacific Fishery Information system (PacFIN), which is a central repository for U.S. West Coast groundfish landings and auxiliary information collected by the three state fishery agencies and other agencies.  A description of basic state data collection systems and overview of PacFIN is provided in Sampson and Crone (1997).  Updated dockside sampling protocols and data processing procedures for Washington are described in Tsou et al. (2015) and Tsou and Weyland (2015).  A variety of sources were used to reconstruct regional landings histories for years earlier than 1981. Comparisons of the commercial catch in each fishery for the current and previous assessments are in Figure 20 (CA), Figure 81 (OR), and Figure 179 (WA).

##### The PacFIN Era: 1981 to 2014
The PacFIN system provides estimates of commercial fishery rockfish landings by species for those strata (year, quarter, port, area, gear type, condition [alive or dead], and market category) that have species composition data available to apportion the landings to species.  For the commercial fisheries in California the source of the information provided to PacFIN is the CalCOM database, which is the repository for commercial groundfish market sample data managed by the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (Pearson et al. 2008).  In either system, when no species composition data are available, the system reports the landings as the nominal species or as the mixed-species category that it was sold as (e.g., small rockfish), depending on how the landings were originally reported.  The amount of unspecified rockfish that cannot be apportioned to species varies by year, area, and gear type.  In many instances the landings of unspecified rockfish reported by PacFIN are quite substantial.

Although the separate geographic assessments by state region would ideally have strict geographic separation of landed catch to the location of capture, this is not possible to accomplish because information on the fishing location is generally unavailable.  Until recently logbooks that report area of capture were only available for landings by the groundfish trawl fleet.  Oregon has required a logbook for commercial vessels participating in its nearshore fishery since 2004.  At the same nearshore stock assessment workshop (PFMC 2015) it was agreed that catch histories for black rockfish stocks should be assembled on the basis of port of landing rather than location of fish capture, based on the assumption that neighboring state would catch approximately equal amounts from off each other's waters.  The one exception to this "port-of-landing equals the state-of-capture rule" is for trawl-caught fish landed at Astoria, OR, the vast majority of which were caught in waters off Washington.

Staff from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) used species composition samples collected during 1976 to 1993 to conduct an analysis of the spatial distribution of black rockfish landed at Astoria, OR.  Astoria is the northernmost port in Oregon and is located near the mouth of the Columbia River, which forms the boundary between Oregon and Washington.  The aggregate proportion of black rockfish expanded pounds that were taken north of the Columbia River (i.e., from waters off Washington) was 98.6%.  This percentage was applied to all historical trawl landings of rockfish at Oregon's Columbia River District ports prior to 1976.vNon-trawl landings into Astoria were assumed to have been caught from Oregon waters.  

Starting in 1994 black rockfish landed into Oregon were legally required to be sorted and sold in a separate black rockfish market category and were also reported as separate retained catches in the mandatory trawl logbooks.  Based on the retained catches reported in the logbooks, the estimated proportion of the trawl-caught black rockfish that were caught from off Washington and landed into Astoria ranged from 65 to 100 percent. These black rockfish are accounted for in the Washington regional assessment (Table 48).

The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) provided commercial fishery landings based on fish ticket records of black rockfish harvested off Oregon by vessels landing at ports in Washington.  Landings were less than 1 mt per year for the period 1971 to 2014; therefore, all landings to Washington ports were assumed to occur in waters off Washington in this assessment.

The landings data series for black rockfish landed in California, Oregon, and Washington during 1981 to 2014 were assembled from three PacFIN or CalCOM data sets.  The first data set consisted of direct estimates of black rockfish landings by state (described as BLCK in PacFIN), which the systems derived from fish tickets, species composition estimates, and trawl-logbooks provided by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), the ODFW, and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW).  The second data set consisted of landings of black rockfish that were nominally landed in the black rockfish market category (described as BLK1 in PacFIN) but no direct species composition samples were available to confirm their purity.  Prior to 1993, there was no sorting requirement in the states and no explicit market category for black rockfish, which were landed in a mixed-species rockfish category.  Starting in 1994, black rockfish landed in Oregon were legally required to be landed and sorted into a separate black rockfish market category.  Similar sorting requirements were implemented in 2001 in California and in 2006 in Washington.  

The third PacFIN data set (URCK in PacFIN) was derived from landings of rockfish for which species composition sample estimates were unavailable, but which might feasibly contain some black rockfish.  This derivation involved applying estimates of the percentages of black rockfish (%Black) to the landings of unspecified rockfish.

For each regional assessment the final values for annual commercial landings of black rockfish were the sum of the original PacFIN estimates, to which were added the nominal landings of black rockfish (listed as black rockfish on fish tickets but not verified by sampling) and the estimates of black rockfish in the unspecified rockfish landings.

The landings series during the PacFIN era are quite erratic, sometimes exhibiting large variations between years.  While these changes could be a true reflection of changing fishing patterns, they may be no more than artifacts of low levels of species composition sampling.  A study of the groundfish landings estimates for California (Pearson et al. 2007) evaluated the reliability of species composition sampling for various rockfish species.  The study noted that black rockfish are readily misidentified as blue rockfish, that the hook-and-line fishery in California was not well sampled until the 1990s, and that many of the California landings estimates are based on "borrowed" data or by treating the black rockfish market category as "pure".
