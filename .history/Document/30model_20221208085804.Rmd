### History of Modeling Approaches Used for this Stock

#### Black Rockfish South of Cape Falcon

The first stock assessment of black rockfish off Oregon (Stewart 1993), which was limited in geographic scope to the northern portion of Oregon, was a Cohort Analysis based on age composition data collected from fish landed at Garibaldi.  The first comprehensive analysis of the black rockfish stock off Oregon and California was by Ralston and Dick (2003), who developed a statistical catch-at-age model using Stock Synthesis.  Sampson (2007) used a similar model configuration and approach.

In the 2007 assessment model the data were organized into three basic gear-types (Hook-and-Line, Trawl, and Recreational), the data from Oregon and California were kept separate, and the tuning indices were recreational angler CPUE series based on the same or similar data sources (MRFSS for both states, ORBS for Oregon, and CPFV surveys for California).  Fishing effort was measured in terms of angler-days rather than the angler-hours metric used in the current California and Oregon regional assessment models.  The 2007 assessment used the ODFW tagging study estimates of black rockfish abundance off Newport as a relative abundance index.  Those data were unavailable for the 2003 assessment.  The 2007 assessment also used a juvenile rockfish pre-recruit index, which was unavailable for the previous assessment.

The landings data series in the 2007 assessment differed quite substantially from the series developed by Ralston and Dick for the 2003 assessment.  Neither of those assessments attempted to account for discards, instead assuming that discards were negligible.


#### Black Rockfish North of Cape Falcon

Three full assessments for black rockfish, conducted in 1994, 1999, and 2007, modeled the black rockfish population found in coastal waters between Cape Falcon, Oregon and north to the U.S./Canadian border (Wallace and Tagart, 1994, Wallace et al (1999), and Wallace, et al., 2008).  There have been no update assessments for black rockfish resources.  

The 1994 assessment utilized a Stock Synthesis model configuration, with two auxiliary data sets as black rockfish abundance indicators, one based on tagging CPUE and one on based coastal recreational bottomfish directed effort (Wallace and Tagart, 1994).

Wallace et al (1999) constructed an assessment model by using the AD Model Builder software (ADMB, Fournier 1997) to assess black rockfish abundance.  Three key features of the 1999 model were (1) the parameterization of the expected catches at age, (2) the definitions of the sampling units for the different types of data inputs, and (3) the integration of tagging data explicitly.  The parameterization chosen mostly affected parameter bias whereas the sampling unit designation mostly affected estimator variance.  Both bias and variance were components of overall parameter uncertainty.  The parameterization and the sampling unit definitions were both designed to conform to the actual sampling protocol used, thereby propagating sampling uncertainty through to the final biomass estimates.

The 2007 assessment (Wallace, et al., 2008) employed Stock Synthesis 2.  Unlike the 1999 assessment, CPUE from the tag release trips and Petersen tagging study abundance estimates were included as relative abundance indices.

# Model description


## Modelling Platform
Stock Synthesis version 3.30.16 was used as the statistical catch-at-age modelling framework. This framework allows the integration of a variety of data types and model specifications. The SS-DL tool (https://github.com/shcaba/SS-DL-tool) was used for model exploration, likelihood profiling, and sensitivity analyses. The companion R package r4ss (version 1.38.0) along with R version 4.0.5 were used to investigate and plot model fits.

2.3.2 Fleet and survey designations
The base case models for each state assessment has an assortment of commercial and recreational fleets, as well as surveys:


### Estimated and Fixed Parameters
All life history parameters are estimated except the CV at length at $t_0$. Estimated parameters in the model are natural mortality ($M$) and all growth parameters ($L_{\infty}$, $k$, $t_0$, CV at $L_{\infty}$; length CV at $t_0$ was fixed as it had little impact on the model) were estimated, as were the two selectivity parameters for each fleet and the survey, the log of the initial recruitment ($logR_0$), and recruitment deviations. Length at maturity, fecundity-weight, and length-weight relationshop, steepness ($h$) and recruitment variance were all fixed. Sensitivity scenarios and likelihood profiles were used to explore uncertainty in the values of the natural mortality and growth parameters. When estimating parameters, the prior for natural mortality was assumed lognormal with a standard deviation of 0.438 (based on the prior developed using the Natural Mortality Tool (see Biology section for more details); growth parameters were estimated with no priors.


### Data Weighting
The reference model estimates additional variance on the Oregon recreational survey data to allow the model to balance model fit to that data while acknowledging that variances may be underestimated in the index standardization. The input CVs range from 1%-7%, which is very small (Table \ref{tab:OR_vermilion_ORBSindex}). A sensitivity was run with no extra variance estimated, as well as removal of the index data.

Initial sample sizes for the commercial and recreational length and conditional age-at-length compositions were based on the number of fish sampled. The method of Francis [-@francis_data_2011, equation TA1.8] was then used to balance the length and conditional age-at-length composition data among other inputs and likelihood components. The Francis method treats mean length and age as indices, with effective sample size defining the variance around the mean. If the variability around the mean does not encompass model predictions, the data should be down-weighted until predictions fit within the intervals. This method accounts for correlation in the data (i.e., the multinomial distribution), but can be sensitive to years that are outliers, as the amount of down-weighting is applied to all years within a data source, and are not year-specific. Sensitivities were performed examining different data-weighting treatments: 1) the Dirichlet-Multinomial approach [@thorson_model-based_2017], 2) the McAllister-Ianelli Harmonic Mean approach [@mcallister_bayesian_1997], or 3) no data-weighting of lengths.


## Model Selection and Evaluation
The base assessment model for Oregon `r spp` was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a spawning output trajectory and realtive stock status for the population of `r spp` in state and federal waters off Oregon. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses different data types and sources to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base model. These include considerations of model structure, data and parameter treatment, estimation phasing, and jittered starting values to achieve a converged and balanced model that provides sensible parameter estimates and derived quantities.
