## Biological Data
The major biological inputs to the models are age and growth parameters, natural mortality, weight-length, maturity and stock-recruitment parameters (Table 40 (OR), and Table 63 (WA)).


### Natural Mortality


### Maturation and Fecundity


### Sex Ratio


### Length-Weight Relationship


### Growth (Length-at-Age)


### Ageing Precision and Bias
