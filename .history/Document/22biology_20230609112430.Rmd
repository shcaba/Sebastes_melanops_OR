## Biological Data and Parameters

The major biological inputs to the models are natural mortality, age and growth parameters, weight-length, maturity and stock-recruitment parameters. The following sections outline the treatment of each section.


### Natural Mortality

Natural mortality is a critical parameter that drives much of the outcome of stock assessments. This value is not directly measured for black rockfish, so it either needs to be estimated or fixed in the model. Prior treatments have either used fixed ramps from lower to higher female natural mortality values (0.16 to 0.24 for females (2007 assessment); 0.17 to 0.2 (2015 assessment)) to constant male natural mortality value (0.16 in 2007; 0.17 in 2015). Females rapidly disappear from the population after 20 years of age, whereas whereas males can still be found in their 30 and 40s, with the oldest individuals along the coast aged at 56 years [@love_2011]. Females are rarely found in their 30s and males in their 40s in Oregon.

The reason for the lack of females has been debated for many years. The "hide them" (using age-based selectivity curves to hide older females) or "kill them" (using the above mentioned ramps of death to account for no older females in samples) was specifically considered since the last assessment among researchers from California to Alaska, and it was agreed that the "hide them" hypothesis is the least feasible situation (see Rasmuson et al. [-@Rasmuson_noBOFFFs_2023] for a specific study that went looking for old females). It was also agreed a constant natural mortality rate should be used for this assessment. 

Determining reasonable natural mortality values is also challenging as the quick disappearance of females form the population after 20 years old challenges typical biological assumptions, especially since black rockfishes have been the focus species when developing the theory of big old fat fecund female contributions to spawning output [@bobko_maturity_2004; @hixon_boffffs_2014]. In a study confirming the advanced capacity for output of older females [@berkeley_maternal_2008] the oldest aged females in the study were under 20 years, so the enhanced reproductive capacity, despite the loss of females after 20 years of age, is still intact. 

Using the Hamel and Cope [-@hamel_Mprior_2022] longevity-based estimator of natural mortality as implemented in the natural mortality tool [-@cope_NMT_2022], the following M values correspond to the longevity estimates:

     *0.108 at 50 years
     *0.135 at 40 years
     *0.180 at 30 years
     *0.216 at 25 years
     *0.270 at 20 years

These provide reasonable bookends for likely natural mortality values for black rockfish. For females, estimates based on the von Bertalanffy growth function range from 0.27-0.32 and for males, 0.34 to 0.38. Those estimates are on the very high side, and thus are not considered further. 

Exploratory runs first attempted to estimate natural mortality with a high bound of 0.25, but this bound was always achieved. This consistent attribute of unconstrained models wanting high natural mortality rates argued for the need to fix natural mortality, as was done in the 2015 assessment. For this reason, the constant natural mortality values of `r round(model$MGparmAdj$NatM_uniform_Fem_GP_1[1], 2)` for females (within the ramp of 0.17 and 0.2 used in that assessment) and `r round(model$MGparmAdj$NatM_uniform_Mal_GP_1[1], 2)` for males (same as the last assessment) were used. A likelihood profile across the above mentioned range of natural mortality values, but maintaining the above ratio of female to male natural mortality, is included to explore model sensitivity and demonstrate the models desire to push the upper bounds of realistic values. 

### Growth (Length-at-Age)

#### Age validation

Fish ages estimated for age-based stock assessment models need to be accurate and precise because ageing error can affect all model input data. Current protocol for ageing groundfish is to count growth marks on break-and-burn preparations of sagittal otoliths [@CARE_2006] but interpreting the growth marks can be challenging and lead to errors in ageing. To validate the break-and-burn ageing method for Black Rockfish off Oregon, researchers at ODFW and the University of Alberta used secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) to determine oxygen isotope ratios (δ18O) in Black Rockfish sagittal otoliths. Because an otolith is acellular, metabolically inert, and grows throughout the life of the fish, any elements accreted onto its surface are permanently retained [@campana_1999]. Otolith oxygen isotopes exist in equilibrium with ambient seawater [@iacumin_1992] and otolith δ18O is inversely related to water temperature and is a function of salinity [@hoie_2004]; therefore, sequential δ18O measurements across the otolith are a proxy for seasonal temperature cycles experienced by the fish throughout its lifespan.

SIMS proved to be effective for producing detailed otolith δ18O chronologies with adequate temporal resolution for identification of seasonal trends in water temperatures. Locations of annuli counted during break-and-burn ageing of Black Rockfish sagittae generally corresponded to maxima in the δ18O chronologies, inferring formation during periods when water temperatures were relatively cold. Generally, chronologies were characterized as having one strong signal peak and trough between annuli; however, δ18O chronologies could be highly irregular and chaotic between maxima, inferring vertical and lateral movements known to occur in this species, as well as prolonged larval duration and settlement in shallow nearshore areas with short-term variation in water temperatures and salinities . The break-and-burn method of ageing was validated for Oregon Black Rockfish up to 12 years old [@terwilliger_2023].


#### Age and growth relationship

The length-at-age was estimated for female and male `r spp` using data from collections sampling the commercial (trawl and non-trawl) and recreational fisheries off the coast of Oregon (Figure \ref{tab:len-age-data-sex} and Figure \ref{tab:len-age-sex-year}), wiht hall lengths in fork length and all ages in years. Figure \ref{fig:len-age-fit} shows the predicted von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) fits to the data. Females grow larger than males and sex-specific growth parameters were estimated at the following values:

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{\infty}$ = 48.82 cm; $k$ = 0.18; $t_0$ = -2.00

Males $L_{\infty}$ = 44.88 cm; $k$ = 0.21; $t_0$ = -2.21

\end{centering}

\vspace{0.5cm}

The coefficient of variation of length by age fluctuated from 0.06 to 0.1 for the most well sampled ages and was similar for each sex (Figure \ref{tab:cv-lt-age}). When estimated in the models, these same values would often be produced, but it was ultimately determined it is more parsimonious to fix to 0.1 for both sexes. 

The estimated VBGF parameters provided initial values for the estimation of growth in the model, as all age and length data are included in the model. The $t_0$ value was fit to zero in the reference model in order to achieve more realistic $L_{\infty}$ and $k$ values. The resultant growth curves estimated by the model are presented in Figure \ref{fig:len-age-ss}. Sensitivity to fixing the growth parameters to the external values or estimating $t_0$ are explored through sensitivity analyses.


### Ageing Precision and Bias

Ageing otoliths, while a common practice, rarely provides a prefect estimate of true age. This ageing error (both in bias and imprecision) can have large effects on stock assessment outputs and should be incorporated when using ages. Several multiple age read studies were available to develop ageing error vectors for use in interpreting conditional ages at length. For Washington, there were two data sets: 1) 280 triple reads from WDFW for the commercial fisheries and 2) 3240 double reads from WDFW for the recreational fishery. For Oregon, the Cooperative Ageing Project (CAP) provided a set of 302 multiple reads (five total readers), while ODFW provided 150 from five readers. California had one set of 318 double reads from the Cooperative Ageing Project (CAP).). Resultant forms for each chosen model are given in Figure 4.

The Punt et al. [-@punt_quantifying_2008] method and accompanying software was used to determine the underlying true age distribution and resultant imprecision, assuming at least one of the readers is unbiased. The first reader in all comparisons was assumed unbiased, but we considered several model configurations based on the functional form (unbiased, linear or curvilinear) of bias in the subsequent readers, and precisions of all readers (constant CV, curvilinear standard deviation, or curvilinear CV). Model selection was based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) corrected for small sample size (AICc), which converges to AIC when sample sizes are large. Both Washington data sets supported a linear bias in the other readers and constant CV of precision for all readers (Table 2). Oregon data sets agreed that linear bias and curvilinear precision was best supported (Table 2). The California data set supports curvilinear bias in the second reader with constant CV for both readers (Table 2). Resultant forms for each chosen model are given in Figure 4.


### Length-Weight Relationship

Length-weight relationships (kg to fork lengths) were developed with state-specific data. The California weight-length relationship was based on 8943 combined sex samples (Table 18). Oregon relationships were based on length and weight measurements from almost 4,000 individual black rockfish of combined sex and was the same as used in the previous assessment (Table 40). Washington relationships were sex-specific and based on 1551 female samples and 1284 males samples (Table 63), though both sexes had very similar relationships.


### Maturation and Fecundity

The black rockfish maturity is assumed to be based on length, as assumed in past assessments. A notable difference in our approach in these assessments is the use of functional maturity instead of sexual maturity (the typical application). Functional maturity is a more stringent definition of maturity as compared to sexual maturity. Instead of just using the presence of yolk as a measure of sexual maturity, functional maturity takes into account both the presence of strict spawning individuals and the level of atresia or skipped spawning. Such an approach yields length at 50% maturity estimates larger than the standard sexual maturity application. Melissa Head of the Northwest Fisheries Science Center provided estimates of both functional and sexual maturity from black rockfish sampled in the months of July to January (deemed the best time for identifying mature individuals) off Oregon and Washington waters combined. The logistic fit to those the functional and sexual maturity values are found in Table 4. The functional maturity values were sampled from individuals from one year, which happened to be the year of the "warm blob". It is therefore unknown how this may have affected the estimate of functional maturity, particularly the levels of mass atresia in older individuals. Discussion in the STAR panel lead to the decision to assume all individuals above 45cm to be mature in the functional maturity data set in order to be conservative on the estimate of the effect of atresia on maturity estimation. The functional maturity values from this modified data set are used for all states, but sensitivities to the new sexual maturity estimate, as well as the respective area values from the previous assessments and the unmodified functional maturity data set are explored.

Similarly, this assessment, like previous assessments, assumes that weight-specific fecundity is linearly related to female body weight. Values for the slope and intercept were taken from Dick [-@dick_modeling_2009] and are found in the parameterization tables (Table 18 (CA); Table 40 (OR); Table 63 (WA)). 


### Stock-recruitment function and compensation

The Beverton-Holt stock-recruit model [@beverton_holt_1957] has been the traditional recruitment function for rockfishes and is assumed for black rockfish.  Specifically, the re-parameterized Beverton-Holt that uses a steepness parameter defined as the proportion of average recruitment for an unfished population expected for a population at 20% of unfished spawning output (Mace and Doonan) was used in these assessments.  This is a notoriously difficult parameter to estimate, thus several attempts to derive a prior of steepness have been attempted [@myers_etal_1995; @dorn_advice_2002].  This prior is typically updated each cycle (following the method of Dorn 2002) and subject to a review by the Council's Science and Statistical Committee.  The prior for 2015 has an expected value of 0.72 and a standard deviation of 0.147 using a beta distribution. Attempts were made to estimate this value, but were not successful, so it is fixed and its influence is explored via a likelihood profile.


### Sex Ratio

No information on the sex ratio at birth was available so it was assumed to be 50:50.
