### Sensitivity Analyses

Several sensitivity runs were considered for the Oregon model. The first group of sensitivity runs (scenarios 1-6; Table 43; Supplemental table �OR Sensitivities- Like Comps�) sequentially removes indices. The second group (scenarios 7-13; Table 43; Supplemental table �OR Sensitivities- Like Comps�) sequentially removes length composition data. The third group (scenarios 14-19; Table 43; Supplemental table �OR Sensitivities- Like Comps�) sequentially removes indices, size or age composition data. The last group (scenarios 19-33; Table 44; Supplemental table �OR Sensitivities- Model specs�) covers a variety of issues: 

1. Estimate M step
2. M step (at age 10) fixed at 2007 values
3. M ramp (at age 10) fixed at 2007 values
4. M estimated, no step
5. M using Then et al. 2015 VBGF calculation; age-based selectivity
6. M based on Then et al. (2015) using amax = 56; age-based selectivity
7. M based on Hamel (2015) using amax = 56; age-based selectivity
8. Estimate female M with male offset set at -0.2
9. Fix tag Q = 12.5%
10. Estimate tag Q
11. Data weighting: length using Francis method; no age weighting
12. Data weighting: lengths and ages using harmonic mean
13. No recruitment estimation
14. No extra variance estimated on all indices 
15. Recreational ocean fishery selectivity logistic

The model was generally insensitive to the removal of indices, except when the tag index was removed as well as the tag Q fixed value. The model was more sensitive to the removal of age compositions, particularly the recreational ocean fishery, resulting mostly in the changes of absolute spawning output. This general insensitivity is due to the fact that tag Q is fixed in the base model. Previous model exploration that did not fix tag Q showed sensitivity to both the length compositions, which favored higher M values, and age compositions, which favored lower M values.

Results of the model specification sensitivity runs demonstrate a strong sensitivity to the scale parameter Q from the tagging data, though selectivity can also change results (Table 44; Figure 153 and Figure 154). The model is very rigid given the fixed value of tag Q. There is very little effect on stock status when changing the parameterization of M, selectivity, data weighting, or the estimation of recruitments (Figure 155 to Figure 158). Only the treatment of the tag Q parameter causes notable results. Because the Oregon model both kills individuals through elevated M values, but also hides the females via dome-shaped selectivity, the biomass unavailable to fishing mortality (�cryptic biomass�) was considered for different values of tag Q. Despite very different assumptions of stock scale and status from the different Q parameters (Figure 153 and Figure 154), the cryptic biomass was comparable (Figure 159 to Figure 161). 

Overall, the scale of the population (and thus the resultant OFL at the proxy FMSY value) is the most sensitive derived quantity. Lower natural mortality rates caused big changes in the spawning output. Such lower productivity also caused reduced OFLs. Estimating recruitment and assuming logistic selectivity for the recreational ocean fishery also caused changes in the population scale.


### Retrospective Analysis

Retrospective runs of for the last 5 years plus and additional retrospective back to 2006 (-8 years, the last year of data available in the previous assessment) were conducted. The Oregon model demonstrates little retrospective patterns in both spawning stock output (Figure 170) and relative spawning stock output (Figure 171). 


### Likelihood Profiles

Profiles for natural mortality, steepness, initial recruitment (lnR0), and the ln(tag Q) are shown in Figure 162 to Figure 169. The data in the model strongly support high M values, though fixing the tag Q has removed the sensitivity of the derived quantities to this M values (Figure 162 and 
Figure 163). Fixing Q also makes all likelihood components support a larger M, whereas when tag Q is estimated, length compositions support higher M values and age composition support lower M values. Profiles over steepness show higher steepness values are most supported and have little influence on the derived quantities (Figure 164). All likelihood components but the abundance indices support higher steepness (Figure 165). The lnR0 parameter is very well defined (Figure 166) and supported consistently by all likelihood components (Figure 167). Higher ln(tag Q values) are most supported by the data, a value very different from the fixed value used in the base model (Figure 168). Derived quantities are very sensitive to the value of this parameter. The ln(tag Q) best supported is most influenced by the age data, with the length data supporting a lower ln(tag Q).
