## Reference Model Diagnostics and Results


### Model Convergence and Acceptability

While there is no definitive measure of model convergence, several measures are routinely applied. These criteria include a low maximum gradient (`r model$maximum_gradient_component`), inversion of the Hessian (passed), acceptable fits to data (passed), and reasonable parameter values (passed). 

Model efficiency was explored by doing a short run Bayesian analysis using the Random Walk Metropolis with 4 chains of 2000 draws, keeping all the draws and examining the fast mixing parameters. Those estimated parameters that do not move much from the initial values slow the model down and are recommended to be fixed at the starting value [@monnahan_overcoming_2019]. This resulted in the fixing of 3 selectivity parameters (Figure \ref{fig:pairs_plot_fast}).

An extra effort was given to ensure the model did not rest on a local likelihood minimum. This was done by starting the minimization process from dispersed parameter values away from the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the approach found a better model fit (i.e., minimum negative log-likelihood value). Starting parameters used a jitter shift value of 0.001. This was repeated 100 times with 17 out of 100 runs returned to the reference model likelihood (Figure \ref{fig:jitter}). A better fit, lower negative log-likelihood model was not found in any of remaining 96 runs. The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering and likelihood profiles, the present reference model represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. 


## Base Model Results

#### Fits to the Data
##### Lengths
Fits to the length data are examined based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets. Fits to the annual length composition are shown in [Appendix A](#app_a). 

Pearson residuals of fits to the fishery and MPA survey length data are reasonably small with no distinct patterns (Figure \ref{fig:lt-pearson-resids}), though the shore-based fishery lengths, which are small samples, show a possible recruitment in 1985 that is not seen in the recruitment residuals. 

Model fits to the mean lengths, assuming Francis data-weighting, do not follow the dynamics in means lengths in the relatively small trawl fishery (Figure \ref{fig:trawl-mean-len-fit}). The mean lengths are bit fit in the larger and better sampled non-trawl (Figure \ref{fig:nontrawl-mean-len-fit}) and ocean boat (Figure \ref{fig:ocean-mean-len-fit}) fisheries. Note the poor fit to the MRFSS-era (pre-2003) mean lengths in the ocean boat fishery. Those length are consistently fit higher than the mean, but the samples are much lower than in the ORBS era sampling. A time block in selectivity was attempted when exploring potential model specifications, but the fits were not improved. The shore-based, also poorly sampled, are not fit well and miss what could be a potential recruitment in the mid-1980s (Figure \ref{fig:shore-mean-len-fit}). Fits to the mean length in the MPA length data are generally good (Figure \ref{fig:mpa-mean-len-fit}). All length weighting are near the value of 1 as is expected when using the Francis weighting method. One thing to note is the general lack of contrast in the data over the past two decades.

Aggregate fits over year by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:agg-len-fit}. The two main fisheries (non-trawl and ocean) and the MPA survey show good fits to the aggregated data. The trawl fishery, which requires the asymptotic size of the populations to be much higher than is expected given the age and growth data, is fit less well. This is instructive to the fact that the trawl fishery is catching only the largest individuals in the population, thus possibly over representing those length classes in the population, and indicating that the non-trawl and ocean fishery is missing some of those bigger fish (i.e., a dome-shaped selectivity). The shore-based fishery is also being fit poorly, but the fishery is so small it makes little difference to model performance.  

##### Conditional Age at Length
Fits to the mostly sex-specific conditional age at length data are examined based on the age-at-length Pearson residuals, the annual mean ages, and mean age at length by year for the trawl, non-trawl and ocean boat fishery samples. The maximum size of the Pearson residuals for each fleets was fairly small (maximum = 13.44, 12.48, and 13.12 for the trawl, non-trawl and ocean boat samples, respectively; [Appendix B](#app_b)). The biggest residuals were limited, as most of the residuals were small and unnoteworthy and demonstrate the expected shape of the growth curve. There is more contrast in the age data, as the mean age by year increased for all fleets through the most recent years (Figures \ref{fig:trawl-mean-caal}, \ref{fig:nontrawl-mean-caal}, and \ref{fig:ocean-mean-caal}). The mean age for the trawl fishery was between 10-15 years, whereas the mean ages for the non-trawl and ocean boat fishery was between 8 and 10 years. Fits to the mean ages by length bins show acceptable fits consistent with model expectations [Appendix C](#app_c).

##### Marginal Age compositions

Marginal age compositions are not fit in the model, but they are included in order to see how well they fit the reference model without influencing the likelihood [Appendix D](#app_d). Marginal length and age composition cannot be used in the same model ginve the overlap of the same fish in both samples. This is why ages conditioned on lengths are often used with the length compositions. But it still stands that age compositions, instead of lengths, could be used. So adding the marginal age compositions passively (i.e., not contributing to the overall likelihood of the model) can offer insight into how consistent they are with the current model fit. Overall the fits are very good, and in an exploratory model run the length compositions were replaced with the age compositions and a very similar model result was obtained. Thus the conditional age at length compositions coupled with either length or age compositions provide similar results. This is likely due to the fact that the conditional ages capture the underlying age structure sufficiently to following the age structure over time.   

##### Fits to Indices of Abundance

The fits to the five available indices of abundance (not including the acoustic-visual survey which the model was predefined to fit with a lnq=0.6) are generally weak. The best fit index is found for the commercial non-trawl fishery (Figure \ref{fig:nontrawl-index-fit}), with a very good fit of an upward trend in the contemporary time series. In an interesting contrast is the ocean boast survey that covers the same years and shows a very similar selectivity, but shows an opposing downward trend (Figure \ref{fig:nontrawl-index-fit}). The earlier time series for the recreational fishery is also not well fit to the dynamics of the model, and requires high additional variance to fit (Figure \ref{fig:nrfss-index-fit}).

The two fishery independent surveys, the MPA (Figure \ref{fig:mpa-index-fit}) and the tagging survey (Figure \ref{fig:tag-index-fit}) are also not well fit. Despite this, the estimated catchability for the tagging survey is 0.3, not far from the assumed value of 0.25 in the 2015 assessment.


### Parameter Estimates

The final base model incorporated aspects of both models proposed to the Mop-up STAR Panel. Below is a list of the more salient specifications (See also Section 2.4.1.2 for comparisons with the California and Washington models, of which the Oregon model shares many similar specifications when not listed below):
* Female M fixed at 0.17, with a step at age 10 to 0.2.
* Male M fixed at 0.17 for all ages.
* Tag Q fixed at 0.25.
* Selectivity for the trawl fishery was logistic and length-based, but allowed to be sex-specific. 
* Selectivity for the ocean-boat recreational fishery was estimated as age-based with dome-shaped parameters for females.
* Conditional age-at-length was weighted using harmonic means.
* Recruitment deviations were not estimated.	


### Fits to the Data

The Oregon base case model shows the indices trending upward in the last three years, with the exception of the Commercial Logbook index.  Fits to the indices were generally poor, with mostly straight-line fits to most of them (Figure 100 to Figure 104).  

Length composition fits are good for the live and dead non-trawl fisheries and for the recreational ocean-boat fishery, which represent the bulk of the data, but poor for the trawl and small fish research study, both of which had small samples sizes (Figure 105  to Figure 119).  Francis weighting are shown in Figure 120 to Figure 124. Fits to the weighted conditional age-at-length compositions show generally good agreement between observed and expected values (Figure 125 to Figure 132).  Estimated selectivity curves show that the trawl fishery is asymptotic in length for males and females, dome-shaped for both sexes in the live and dead fish fishery and the small fish for research survey, and dome-shaped and age-based for females in the recreational ocean fishery (Figure 147 to Figure 149).

Sex-specific growth was estimated in the base model (Figure 150, Table 40).  Females grew bigger than males (Figure 149) and both were similar to the values estimated when the data was fit outside the model.

A total of sixteen primary parameters were estimated, along with sixty recruitment deviations. The reference model parameter estimates along with asymptotic standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:model-param} and the likelihood components are shown in Table \ref{tab:likes}. Estimates of derived reference points and approximate 95 percent asymptotic confidence intervals are provided in Table \ref{tab:referenceES}. 

The natural mortality for females and males was estimated at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1", 3],3)` and `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "NatM_p_1_Mal_GP_1", 3],3)` yr^-1^, respectively. These values are below the mean prior value, but not unreasonable given the corresponding longevities would be between 67 and 75 years old and the sampled maximum age of 68 came from a fished population.

The estimates of sex-specific growth parameters showed some differences from the externally estimated starting values (Table \ref{tab:model-param} and Figure \ref{fig:len-age-ss}). While $L_{\infty}$ was similar to the external estimates, the model estimated $k$ for female and male fish were greater than the values estimated externally (`r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "VonBert_K_Fem_GP_1", 3],3)`  for females and `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "VonBert_K_Fem_GP_1", 3]*exp(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "VonBert_K_Mal_GP_1", 3]),3)` yr^-1^ for males).  The majority of female and male `r spp` growth occurs at younger ages, reaching near maximum length by age 20-25, depending upon sex, with female `r spp` reaching larger maximum lengths (Figure \ref{fig:len-age-ss}). 

The estimated logistic selectivity curves for the commericial and recreational fishery look plausible (i.e., as a model convergence check for realism, the selectivity curves are not overtly outrageous) for each fishery and are very similar to each other (Figure \ref{fig:fleet_selectivity}). Length at 50% selectivity (commercial = `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Size_DblN_peak_Commercial(1)", 3],2)` cm; recreational = `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Size_DblN_peak_Recreational(2)", 3],2)` cm) was between the length at 50% (39.4 cm) and 95% maturity (48 cm). Future assessments could opt for parsimony and combine these two fisheries into one combined selectivity, though the model had no issue adding two more parameters given the available length data.

The time series of estimated recruitments and annual recruitment deviations are shown in Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:rec-devs}. Years with the highest recruitment deviations were estimated to have occurred in 1993-1994, 1998, 2005, and 2015. The variance check on the recruitment deviations indicates well informed recruitments from 1980 to 2015, providing justifation for the estimation of recruitment. Recruitment deviations after 2015 are relatively uninformed with estimated deviations near zero where recruitment is estimated primarily based on the spawner-recruit curve (Figure \ref{fig:bh-curve}). The recruitment bias adjustment applied within the model across years is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bias-adj}.


### Population Trajectory

The Oregon base case model shows the indices trending upward in the last three years, with the exception of the Commercial Logbook index.  Fits to the indices were generally poor, with mostly straight-line fits to most of them (Figure 100 to Figure 104).  

The predicted spawning output (in millions of eggs) is provided in Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and plotted in Figure \ref{fig:ssb}. Estimated spawning output shows a large decline starting in the 1970s, with a continued decline into the late 1990s. This tracks the time period of major removals, though removals have stayed somewhat elevated since. Strong recruitments since the 1990s have supported the elevated catches. The estimate of total biomass over time, which tracks that of spawning output, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tot-bio}.

Relative spawning output declined below the management target ($SB_{40\%}$) by the 1990s, but quickly rebounded to high relative spawning output, but has declined over the past 10 years (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The relative stock status at the start of `r endyr + 1` (`r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Bratio_2021','Value'], 2)`) is estimated to be well above the rockfish relative biomass target of 0.4. Uncertainty intervals are wide given the number of estimated parameters, and indicate the population never goes below the management target ($SB_{40\%}$). The strong recruitment events that are supported by all fishery-dependent data sources are responsible for the dramatic increase and elevated stock status. Numbers of age-0 individuals indcate those years of particularly strong recruitment (Figure \ref{fig:recruits}).
