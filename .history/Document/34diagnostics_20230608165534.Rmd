#### Characterizing uncertainty
### Sensitivity Analyses

Several sensitivity runs were considered for the Oregon model. The first group of sensitivity runs (scenarios 1-6; Table 43; Supplemental table "OR Sensitivities- Like Comps") sequentially removes indices. The second group (scenarios 7-13; Table 43; Supplemental table "OR Sensitivities- Like Comps") sequentially removes length composition data. The third group (scenarios 14-19; Table 43; Supplemental table "OR Sensitivities- Like Comps") sequentially removes indices, size or age composition data. The last group (scenarios 19-33; Table 44; Supplemental table "OR Sensitivities- Model specs") covers a variety of issues: 

1. Estimate M step
2. M step (at age 10) fixed at 2007 values
3. M ramp (at age 10) fixed at 2007 values
4. M estimated, no step
5. M using Then et al. 2015 VBGF calculation; age-based selectivity
6. M based on Then et al. (2015) using amax = 56; age-based selectivity
7. M based on Hamel (2015) using amax = 56; age-based selectivity
8. Estimate female M with male offset set at -0.2
9. Fix tag Q = 12.5%
10. Estimate tag Q
11. Data weighting: length using Francis method; no age weighting
12. Data weighting: lengths and ages using harmonic mean
13. No recruitment estimation
14. No extra variance estimated on all indices 
15. Recreational ocean fishery selectivity logistic

The model was generally insensitive to the removal of indices, except when the tag index was removed as well as the tag Q fixed value. The model was more sensitive to the removal of age compositions, particularly the recreational ocean fishery, resulting mostly in the changes of absolute spawning output. This general insensitivity is due to the fact that tag Q is fixed in the base model. Previous model exploration that did not fix tag Q showed sensitivity to both the length compositions, which favored higher M values, and age compositions, which favored lower M values.

Results of the model specification sensitivity runs demonstrate a strong sensitivity to the scale parameter Q from the tagging data, though selectivity can also change results (Table 44; Figure 153 and Figure 154). The model is very rigid given the fixed value of tag Q. There is very little effect on stock status when changing the parameterization of M, selectivity, data weighting, or the estimation of recruitments (Figure 155 to Figure 158). Only the treatment of the tag Q parameter causes notable results. Because the Oregon model both kills individuals through elevated M values, but also hides the females via dome-shaped selectivity, the biomass unavailable to fishing mortality ("cryptic biomass") was considered for different values of tag Q. Despite very different assumptions of stock scale and status from the different Q parameters (Figure 153 and Figure 154), the cryptic biomass was comparable (Figure 159 to Figure 161). 

Overall, the scale of the population (and thus the resultant OFL at the proxy FMSY value) is the most sensitive derived quantity. Lower natural mortality rates caused big changes in the spawning output. Such lower productivity also caused reduced OFLs. Estimating recruitment and assuming logistic selectivity for the recreational ocean fishery also caused changes in the population scale.

WA:
Several sensitivity runs were considered for the Washington model. The first group of sensitivity runs (scenarios 2-4; Table 65; Supplemental table "WA Sensitivities- Like Comps") sequentially removes indices. The second group (scenarios 5-9; Table 65; Supplemental table "WA Sensitivities- Like Comps") sequentially removes length composition data. The third group (scenarios 10-13; Table 65; Supplemental table "WA Sensitivities- Like Comps") sequentially removes age composition data. The last group (scenarios 14-36: Table 66; Supplemental table "WA Sensitivities- Model specs") covers a variety of issues

1. Estimate growth deviations (1980-2014)
2. Estimate growth blocks (1980-1999; 2000-2014)
3. M ramp in females as in 2007 assessment.
4. Estimate M ramp
5. Fix M to Hamel approach value (0.0964)

20. Use harmonic mean when tuning length compositions
21. Use harmonic mean when tuning length and conditional age-at-length compositions
22. No extra variance estimated on all indices 
23. Recreational fleet length selectivity is dome-shaped 

Results of the likelihood component sensitivity runs are found in Table 65. The model was most sensitive to the exclusion of the dockside recreational index. It was also sensitive to the removal of all length and age data, and particularly to the recreational age data. 

Results of the model specification sensitivity runs are found in Table 66. The largest sensitivities were found in the treatment of maturity, selectivity and natural mortality. The use of sexual maturity (scenarios 24-27) changed the terminal year scale and status of the stock significantly, making it much less reduced in status, though having a smaller influence on catch at SPR50% (Table 21). Natural mortality scenarios with lower M but age-based selectivity had the biggest effect in spawning output (Figure 225), whereas scenarios with ramping of M caused the biggest changes in (i.e., improving) stock status (Figure 226). Fixing M to low values but not compensating with dome-shaped, age-based selectivity caused the population to crash. Scenarios with ramps in M or M estimated, regardless of selectivity form for females, caused the biggest increases in catch at SPR50%. Recruitment deviations are relatively insensitive to the different natural mortality specifications (Figure 227). Most natural mortality scenarios bring the fishing intensity below the SPR harvest level (Figure 228). 


### Likelihood Profiles
Likelihood profiles were conducted for the acoustic-visual survey catchability (q) in natural log-space (ln($q$)), steepness ($h$), and female and male natural mortality ($M$) varying together with a constant ratio matching the reference model (0.19/0.17, female and male values respectively). Likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the featured parameter(s) at specific values across a range of values and estimating all remaining parameters. A likelihood profile offers insight into model sensitivity to changing model parameter values, while providing an additional way to describe uncertainty in the parameter by indentifying the range of parameters within 1.96 likelihood units of the reference model.

The profile on the assumption of the acoustic-visual survey catchaility demonstrates the expected scaling up and down of the population with the decrease and increase of the catchability, respectively (Figure \ref{fig:sAVq-profile}). The change in the current spawning output is steeper than the initial spawning output, leading to a steep decline in relative biomass as ln(a) gets larger. As the ln($q$) approaches 1.5, the stock approaches the overfished limit reference point. The most supported value of the log of catchability is found near 1.17 with a very tight support interval. The most prominent length data (in samples and associated fisheries) support larger ln($q$) values 

The steepness profile showed little information content for this parameter (Figure \ref{fig:steepness-profile-combo}). Despite low information content, model output show little senstivity for $h$ > 0.45, with values for relative stock status ranging between 0.7 and 0.8. Scale outputs ($SB_0$ and $SB_2021$) also showed little change across steepness values. The recruitment likelihood was the biggest driver of steepness towards a value of 1 (Figure \ref{fig:steepness-profile-combo}). 

 The combined profile that varies female and male $M$ based on the reference offset together at the same changing value behave diretionally most like the female likelihood support values in the range of the individual parameter likelihoods (Figure \ref{fig:M-multiprofile-combo}). Scale and relative stock status are affected by this parameter, with the current spawning output being affected more than initial biomass. This is particularly true as $M$ gets larger, creating much higher biomass and higher relative stock status. The uncertainty in the relative stock status ranges from 0.05 to 0.09, very consistent with the asymptotic uncertainty intervals for this value from in reference model. Comparing the asymmetric range of relative stock status estimates in the profiled values (Figure \ref{fig:M-multiprofile-Bratio}) to the normally distributed uncertainty envelope in the reference model (Figure \ref{fig:depl}), one can clearly see the overestimation of the low end of relative stock status when assuming a normal error distribution. The index provided the strongest data signal for natural mortality, with length and age data being much less informative, but not inconsistent with the index.



### Retrospective Analysis

A ten-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model and sequentially removing one year of data up through minus 10 years. Retrospective spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:retro-ssb}) and relatives stock status (Figure \ref{fig:retro-depl}) estimates show a large shift away from a growing population once the acoustic-visual survey is removed from the population. The scale shifts downward and the population status show a declining population at or below the unfished level. This shows the weight of the treatment choice in the acoustic survey, as well as the more recent data that confirm a recent recruitment.
