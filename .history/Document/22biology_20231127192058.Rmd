## Biological Data and Parameters

The major biological inputs to the models are natural mortality, age and growth parameters, weight-length, maturity and stock-recruitment parameters. The following sections outline the treatment of each section.


### Natural Mortality

Natural mortality is a critical parameter that drives much of the outcome of stock assessments. This value is not directly measured for `r spp`, so it either needs to be estimated or fixed in the model. Prior treatments have either used fixed ramps from lower to higher female natural mortality values (0.16 to 0.24 for females (2007 assessment); 0.17 to 0.2 (2015 assessment)) to constant male natural mortality value (0.16 in 2007; 0.17 in 2015). Females rapidly disappear from the population after 20 years of age, whereas whereas males can still be found in their 30 and 40s, with the oldest individuals along the coast aged at 56 years [@love_2011]. Females are rarely found in their 30s and males in their 40s in Oregon.

The reason for the lack of females has been debated for many years. The "hide them" (using age-based selectivity curves to hide older females) or "kill them" (using the above mentioned ramps of death to account for no older females in samples) was specifically considered since the last assessment among researchers from California to Alaska, and it was agreed that the "hide them" hypothesis is the least feasible situation (see Rasmuson et al. [-@Rasmuson_noBOFFFs_2023] for a specific study that went looking for old females). It was also agreed a constant natural mortality rate should be used for this assessment. 

Determining reasonable natural mortality values is also challenging as the quick disappearance of females from the population after 20 years old challenges typical biological assumptions, especially since `r spp` have been the focus species when developing the theory of big old fat fecund female contributions to spawning output [@bobko_maturity_2004; @hixon_boffffs_2014]. In a study confirming the advanced capacity for output of older females [@berkeley_maternal_2008] the oldest aged females in the study were under 20 years, so the enhanced reproductive capacity, despite the loss of females after 20 years of age, is still intact. 

Using the Hamel and Cope [-@hamel_Mprior_2022] longevity-based estimator of natural mortality as implemented in the natural mortality tool [-@cope_NMT_2022], the following M values correspond to the longevity estimates:

- 0.108 at 50 years
- 0.135 at 40 years
- 0.180 at 30 years
- 0.216 at 25 years
- 0.270 at 20 years

These provide reasonable bookends for likely natural mortality values for black rockfish. For females, estimates based on the von Bertalanffy growth function range from 0.27-0.32 and for males, 0.34 to 0.38. Those estimates are on the very high side, and thus are not considered further. 

Exploratory runs first attempted to estimate natural mortality with a high bound of 0.25, but this bound was always achieved. This consistent attribute of unconstrained models wanting high natural mortality rates argued for the need to fix natural mortality, as was done in the 2015 assessment. For this reason, the constant natural mortality values of `r round(model$MGparmAdj$NatM_uniform_Fem_GP_1[1], 2)` for females (within the ramp of 0.17 and 0.2 used in that assessment) and `r round(model$MGparmAdj$NatM_uniform_Mal_GP_1[1], 2)` for males (same as the last assessment) were used. A likelihood profile across the above mentioned range of natural mortality values, but maintaining the above ratio of female to male natural mortality, is included to explore model sensitivity and demonstrate the models desire to push the upper bounds of realistic values. 

### Growth (Length-at-Age)

#### Age validation

Fish ages estimated for age-based stock assessment models need to be accurate and precise because ageing error can affect all model input data. Current protocol for ageing groundfishes is to count growth marks on break-and-burn preparations of sagittal otoliths [@CARE_2006] but interpreting the growth marks can be challenging and lead to errors in ageing. To validate the break-and-burn ageing method for `r spp` off Oregon, researchers at ODFW and the University of Alberta used secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) to determine oxygen isotope ratios (δ18O) in Black Rockfish sagittal otoliths. Because an otolith is acellular, metabolically inert, and grows throughout the life of the fish, any elements accreted onto its surface are permanently retained [@campana_1999]. Otolith oxygen isotopes exist in equilibrium with ambient seawater [@iacumin_1992] and otolith δ18O is inversely related to water temperature and is a function of salinity [@hoie_2004]; therefore, sequential δ18O measurements across the otolith are a proxy for seasonal temperature cycles experienced by the fish throughout its lifespan.

SIMS proved to be effective for producing detailed otolith δ18O chronologies with adequate temporal resolution for identification of seasonal trends in water temperatures. Locations of annuli counted during break-and-burn ageing of Black Rockfish sagittae generally corresponded to maxima in the δ18O chronologies, inferring formation during periods when water temperatures were relatively cold. Generally, chronologies were characterized as having one strong signal peak and trough between annuli; however, δ18O chronologies could be highly irregular and chaotic between maxima, inferring vertical and lateral movements known to occur in this species, as well as prolonged larval duration and settlement in shallow nearshore areas with short-term variation in water temperatures and salinities. The break-and-burn method of ageing was validated for Oregon Black Rockfish up to 12 years old [@terwilliger_2023].

An additional study by Stephens et al., currently in review, used bomb radio carbon to validate Black Rockfish ages. This study had older fish than the Terwilliger et al. 2023 study but the fish were sourced entirely from the California stock. This study found that ages obtained by break-and-burn were systematically biased towards under-ageing. Further, the magnitude of the under-ageing increased as the fish got older. However, since none of the age readers in this study conducted any of the ageing for the Oregon stock and the fish were from California, additional research is needed to determine how best to incorporate these data into future stock assessments.

#### Age and growth relationship

The length-at-age was estimated for female and male `r spp` using data from collections sampling the commercial (trawl and non-trawl) and recreational fisheries off the coast of Oregon (Figure \ref{fig:len-age-data-sex} and Figure \ref{fig:len-age-sex-year}), with all lengths in fork length and all ages in years. Figure \ref{fig:len-age-fit} shows the predicted von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) fits to the data. Females grow larger than males and sex-specific growth parameters were estimated at the following values:

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{\infty}$ = 48.82 cm; $k$ = 0.18 per year; $t_0$ = -2.00

Males $L_{\infty}$ = 44.88 cm; $k$ = 0.21 per year; $t_0$ = -2.21

\end{centering}

\vspace{0.5cm}

The coefficient of variation of length by age fluctuated around 0.06 to 0.1 for the most well sampled ages and was similar for each sex (Figure \ref{fig:cv-lt-age}). When estimated in the models, these same values would often be produced, but it was ultimately determined it is more parsimonious to fix to 0.1 for both sexes. 

The estimated VBGF parameters provided initial values for the estimation of growth in the model, as all age and length data are included in the model. The $t_0$ value was fit to zero in the reference model in order to achieve more realistic $L_{\infty}$ and $k$ values. The resultant growth curves estimated by the model are presented in Figure \ref{fig:len-age-ss}. Sensitivity to fixing the growth parameters to the external values or estimating $t_0$ are explored through sensitivity analyses.


### Ageing Bias and Precision

Counting ages from ageing structures in long-lived, temperate fishes is challenging. Ages derived from these structures can be hard to reproduce within and between readers (i.e., imprecision), and may not contain the true age (i.e., bias). Stock assessment outputs can be affected by bias and imprecision in ageing, thus it is important to quantify and integrate this source of variability when fitting age data in assessments. In Stock Synthesis, this is done by including ageing error matrices that include the mean age (row 1) and standard deviation in age (row 2). Ageing bias is implemented when the inputted mean age deviates from the expected middle age for any given age bin (e.g., 1.75 inputted versus 1.5 being the true age); ageing imprecision is given as the standard deviation for each age bin (row 2).

The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has a long history of ageing `r spp`. Because of this long tenure, the main age reader has changed several times over the years. There are six distinct age readers, but the most current age reader has concluded a comparison among all of the other age readers. The most recent reader is considered the least biased. This assumption enables the construction of ageing error matrices relative to the most recent reader, thus resulting in 6 different ageing error matrices for each period:

- up to 2000: Reader 1 vs Readers 5 & 6
- 2001: Reader 1 vs Reader 5
- 2002: Reader 1 vs Reader 4
- 2003 to 2009: Reader 1 vs Reader 3
- 2003 to 2016 (recreational only in 2016): Reader 1 vs Reader 2
- 2016 (commercial) to 2022: Reader 1 vs Reader 1


Estimation of ageing error matrices used the approach of Punt et al. [-@punt_quantifying_2008] and release 1.1.0 of the R package \href{https://github.com/pfmc-assessment/nwfscAgeingError}{nwfscAgeingError} [@thorson_nwfscageingerror:_2012]. The ageing error matrix offers a way to calculate both bias and imprecision in age reads. Reader 1 is always considered unbiased, but may be imprecise. Bias relative to the primary reader is given for the second or additional readers. Several model configurations are available for exploration based on either the functional form (e.g., constant CV, curvilinear standard deviation, or curvilinear CV) of the bias in the second read or reader or in the precision of the readers. Model selection uses AIC corrected for small sample size (AICc), which converges to AIC when sample sizes are large. Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was also considered when selecting a final model. Table \ref{tab:age-error-models} through Table \ref{tab:age-error-models3} provide model selection results.

Age bias plots are provided in Figure \ref{fig:age1-plot}. The calculated bias relationships from the best fit model are shown in Figure \ref{fig:age-error-sd} and show only small biases between readers. Figure \ref{fig:age-error-bias} shows the imprecision estimates of the best fit models. In the cases where two models were similarly selected, the least extreme form (i.e., drastic drops or increases in imprecision) were chosen for the final matrix. Each ageing error matrix was then applied to the appropriate time and fleet combination.


### Length-Weight Relationship

The length(cm)-weight(kg) relationship for `r spp` was estimated outside the model using biological data available from the Oregon commercial and recreational fisheries (Figure \ref{fig:len-weight-data}). The resultant relationship is very similar for both males and females, and is very close also to what is seen in the state of Washington (Figure \ref{fig:len-weight-or-wa}). The estimated length-weight relationship for female fish was $W$=`r format(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Fem[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Fem[1],2)`^ and males at $W$=`r format(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Mal[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Mal[1], 2)`^.

### Maturation and Fecundity

Black Rockfish maturity was assumed to be based on length, as in past assessments. This assessment used functional maturity instead of biological maturity to describe the maturity schedule. Functional maturity was classified by a more stringent definition of maturity that considered abortive maturation (delayed participation in reproductive event), skipped spawning (mature individuals forgo spawning), and level of follicular atresia as opposed to biological maturity that only considers physiological development. Functional maturity included the biologically mature individuals that were actually expected to contribute to spawning in a given year.

Claire Rosemond (Oregon State University) and Melissa Head (Northwest Fisheries Science Center) provided estimates of both biological and functional maturity for Black Rockfish sampled in 2014 to 2021 from September through April (the time period that includes yolk development and spawning). Samples were collected for fish caught in Oregon and Washington waters by biologists at Oregon State University, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. Biological maturity and functional maturity observations were fitted in separate models. Biological maturity and functional maturity status observations (0 = immature and 1 = mature, n = 644) were fitted in a logistic regression model (glm function, family = binomial, link = “logit”) and flexible spline model [[@head_applying_2020]]. The estimated model parameters were used to calculate length at 50% maturity (L50%; Table \ref{tab:bio-fxn-maturity}) and maturity ogives (Figure \ref{fig:bio-fxn-mat-color}). The delta method was used to calculate 95% confidence intervals for estimated L50% in the logistic regression and a bootstrapping method was used to calculate 95% confidence intervals for L50% in the flexible spline model.

A flexible spline model can capture skipped spawning in the maturity ogive by allowing a decreased asymptote from 1.0. There was evidence of skipped spawning in larger size classes and so the flexible spline model was determined to be the best representation of the reproductive biology of Black Rockfish for the sampled time period (Figure \ref{fig:fxn-spline-mat-color}). The maturity vector input into the model as a fixed relationship is shown in Figure \ref{fig:maturity}. Sensitivity of model output to the use of the biological and functional logistic relationships are explored.


The `r spp` fecundity-at-length  relationship was provided by E.J. Dick (SWFSC) and based on the work from Dick [-@dick_modeling_2009]. The fecundity relationship was estimated equal to $Fec$=`r format(model$MGparmAdj$Eggs_scalar_Fem[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(model$MGparmAdj$Eggs_exp_len_Fem[1],2)`^ in billions of eggs where $L$ is length in cm. Fecundity-at-length is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fecundity}.


### Stock-Recruitment Function and Compensation

The Beverton-Holt stock-recruit model [@beverton_holt_1957] has been the traditional recruitment function for rockfishes and is assumed for black rockfish.  Specifically, the re-parameterized Beverton-Holt that uses a steepness parameter defined as the proportion of average recruitment for an unfished population expected for a population at 20% of unfished spawning output (Mace and Doonan) was used in these assessments.  This is a notoriously difficult parameter to estimate, thus several attempts to derive a prior of steepness have been attempted [@myers_etal_1995; @dorn_advice_2002]. The Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (developed for use West Coast rockfish assessments) was reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) in 2017, and is the primary source of information on steepness for west coast rockfishes. The prior ($h$; beta distribution with $\mu$=`r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)` and $\sigma$=0.15) is used in this assessment, but attempts to estimate steepness were not successful, so it is fixed and its influence is explored via a likelihood profile.


### Sex Ratio

No information on the sex ratio at birth was available so it was assumed to be 50:50.
