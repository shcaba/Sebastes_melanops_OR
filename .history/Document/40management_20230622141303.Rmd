# Management 

## Reference Points

Reference points were based on the rockfish FMSY proxy ($\text{SPR}_{50\%}$), target relative biomass (40%), and estimated selectivity and catch for each fleet (Table \ref{tab:ReferencePoints}). The yield values are lower than the previous assessment for similar reference points due to updated life history estimates. The proxy FMSY values of management quantities, based on exploitation rates that achieve $\text{SPR}_{50\%}$ and $\text{SO}_{40\%}$, are more conservative (lower) than the exploitation rate at estimated MSY. Sustainable total yield using the proxy $\text{SPR}_{50\%}$ is `r format(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value'], digits = 3, scientific = FALSE, big.mark = ',')` mt. The spawning output equivalent to 40 percent of the unfished spawning output ($\text{SO}_{40\%}$) calculated using the SPR target ($\text{SPR}_{50\%}$) was `r format(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'SSB_Btgt', 'Value'], digits = 4, scientific = FALSE, big.mark = ',')` meggs. 

Recent removals have been close to the point estimate of potential long-term yields calculated using an $\text{SPR}_{50\%}$ reference point, though the population size has continued to increase over recent years due to several above average recruitments. The equilibrium estimates of yield relative to biomass based on a steepness value fixed at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"], 2)` are provided in Figure \ref{fig:yield}, where vertical dashed lines indicate the estimate of fraction unfished at the start of `r endyr +1` (current) and the estimated management targets calculated based on the relative target biomass (B target), the SPR target, and the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). 

The 2023 spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is above (55 percent) the management target of 40 percent of unfished spawning output (i.e., 1.38 times above the target spawning output; Figure \ref{fig:es-phase}). The relative biomass and the ratio of the estimated SPR to the management target ($\text{SPR}_{50\%}$) across all model years are shown in Figure \ref{fig:es-phase} where warmer colors (red) represent early years and colder colors (blue) represent recent years.  There have been periods where the stock status has decreased below the target and fishing intensity has been higher than the target fishing intensity based on $\text{SPR}_{50\%}$. Fishing intensity during the most recent year (2022) is estimated to be slightly below the fishing intensity target (0.96 times $\text{SPR}_{50\%}$; Figure \ref{fig:es-phase}).


## Management performance

`r spp` removals have generally been below the equivalent ABC-ACL over the recent decade, with the exception of 2017 and 2022 when removals were slightly higher (Table \ref{tab:manage}). Exploitation on `r spp` increased starting around 1940 and reached a high in the late 1970s. Since that time, catch has mostly fluctuated between 300 and 500 mt per year, with some years exceeding 600 mt. Removals have averaged 483 mt over the past decade. The last ten years of `r spp` acceptable biological catch (ABC) and annual catch limit (ACL) have been set, by definition, below the overfishing limit (OFL) (Table \ref{tab:manage}). Prior to 2017, management specifications were set for `r spp` in California and Oregon waters combined.  The `r spp` OFL has not been exceeded by Oregon removals over the past decade. The ACL and ABC were exceeded in 2017 and 2022 by a small margin, but were more than offset by underages in intervening years.


## Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties

The biggest uncertainty and unresolved conflict is trying to reconcile the signal in the biological data (which suggests a lower population size and status) versus the acoustic and tag surveys (which suggest high stock sizes and status). This is the major issue the current assessment is confronting. Another acoustic-visual survey data point could help resolve how much uncertainty there is in the estimate. The lack of contrast in the biological data, despite large sample sizes, is another barrier to interpreting the current conditions, though given models using only biological data, the signal seems clear that the population could be at a lower stock status.


## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

The following text will be modified, as appropriate, after the STAR panel and SSC meeting.

The `r spp` assessment is being considered as a category 2 assessment with a $P^*$ = 0.45, sigma = 0.72, and a time-varying buffer applied to the OFL.  These multipliers are also combined with the rockfish MSY proxy of FSPR=50% MSY and the 40-10 harvest control rule to calculate OFLs, ABCs and ACLs. A twelve year (2023-2034) projection of the reference model using these specifications along with input removals for 2023 and 2024 provided by the Groundfish Management Team is provided in Table \ref{tab:project}.

Uncertainty in management quantities for the reference model was characterized by exploring various model specifications in a decision table. Initial explorations considered alternative specifications of catchability for the acoustic-visual survey. The resultant decision table will be provided in Table \ref{tab:dec-tab}.

Given the desire for states of nature to represent uncertainty in both scale and relative stock status, the treatment of the acoustic visual survey q, either being estimated by the model or being fixed to a value of 1, are reasonable alternative model structure hypotheses that collectively give a wide range of uncertainty in the current status and trend of `r spp` in Oregon. Figure \ref{fig:stateofnature_SO} and Figure \ref{fig:stateofnature_depl} present spawning output and relative stock status, respectively, of the three states of nature.

Further details about selecting the decision table states of nature will be added here after the STAR panel.    

Further details summarizing the results presented in the decision table will be added here after the STAR panel.


## Evaluation of Scientific Uncertainty

The model-estimated uncertainty around the `r endyr+1` spawning output was $\sigma$ = `r round(model$Pstar_sigma,2)` and the uncertainty around the OFL was $\sigma$ = `r round(model$OFL_sigm, 2)`. This is clearly an underestimate of overall uncertainty because of the necessity to fix some life history parameters such as natural mortality and steepness, as well as a lack of explicit incorporation of model structural uncertainty. The alternative states of nature used to bracket uncertainty in the decision table assist with encapsulating model structure uncertainty. 

## Regional Management Considerations

This stock assessment is specifically for `r spp` in state and federal waters off Oregon.  As such, no specific regional management considerations and associated documentation is anticipated to be required. Separate stock assessments conducted in 2023 for `r spp` off of California and Washington can be found on the Pacific Fishery Management Council website ([hyperlink](https://www.pcouncil.org/stock-assessments-star-reports-stat-reports-rebuilding-analyses-terms-of-reference/groundfish-stock-assessment-documents/)).

## Research and Data Needs

This section briefly highlights progress on research and data needs identified in the most recent (2015) `r spp` assessment, and then provides recommendations for future research.

Research and data needs identified in the last assessment (italics) are listed here followed by a brief response for each.

\textit{Further investigation into the movement and behavior of older (> age 10) females to reconcile their absence in fisheries data. If the females are currently inaccessible to fishing gear, can we find where they are? This information is essential before another black rockfish assessment is undertaken.} Response: Work by ODFW, Rasmuson et al. [-@Rasmuson_noBOFFFs_2023], specifically looked at finding older female `r spp`. While this work was a step in the right direction, more hypothesis-drive work is needed to reconcile the fate of older females (thus this recommendation remains moving forward, see item 1 below).

\textit{Appropriate natural mortality values for females and males. This will help resolve the extent to which dome-shaped age-based selectivity may be occurring for each. This is a larger question on how to empirically estimate $M$ when direct measures are not available, which is usually the case.} Response: While natural mortality remains an unknown, this assessment does explore the estimation of $M$ using informed priors based on the Hamel and Cope [-@hamel_Mprior_2022] method. Research related to male and female $M$ remains a topic for further research (see item 3 below).

\textit{All states needed improved historical catch reconstructions. The trawl fishery catches in particular need particular attention. Given the huge historical removals of that fleet in each state, the assessment is very sensitive to the assumed functional form of selectivity. A synoptic catch reconstruction is recommended, where states work together to resolve cross-state catch issues as well as standardize the approach to catch recommendations.} Response: While work has been conducted to improve historical catch reconstruction for various fleets (much of which went into the updated catch time-series used in this assessment), there still is more work to do (see item 4 below).

\textit{Identifying stanzas or periods of uncertainty in the historical catch series will aid in the exploration of catch uncertainty in future assessment sensitivity runs.} Response: This has largely been addressed with recent historic catch reconstruction updates.

\textit{The ODFW tagging study off Newport should be continued and expanded to other areas. To provide better prior information on the spatial distribution of the black rockfish stock, further work should be conducted to map the extent of black rockfish habitat and the densities of black rockfish residing there.} Response: The coastwide `r spp` acoustic-visual survey conducted in 2021 used contemporary habitat maps during study design development and has a goal of estimating coastwide abundance as well as habitat-specific densities.

\textit{Interpreting the ODFW tagging study needs further work. The Brownie model is a closed-model estimate of abundance, an assumption that could have meaningful influence on the interpretation of the survey catchability. Given that catchability parameter is currently driving the Oregon, realistic values for it need further consideration.} Response: The coastwide acoustic-visual survey was used to pin the absolute estimate of abundance in 2021, thereby providing an anchor for the tagging data catchability.

\textit{Age validation and verification is still needed, particularly in Oregon. A number of historical ages were excluded from the Oregon model due to concerns over differences among age readers. These age structures need to be re-read to recovery the information in those samples. Historical structures from trawl and recreational fisheries in particular should be re-aged by reliable readers and included in future assessments. Oregon ageing error was also quite different from the other two states, so further investigation on the inter-reader error and how to decrease it need reconsideration.} Response: Considerable effort went into not only reading new `r spp` ages but also double reading historical age structures (see the section on Ageing Bias and Precision for specific details).

\textit{An independent nearshore survey should be supported in all states to avoid the reliance on fishery-based CPUE indices.} Response: A coastwide acoustic-visual survey was conducted in Oregon waters during 2021.

\textit{Stock structure for black rockfish is a complicated topic that needs further analysis. How this is determined (e.g., exploitation history, genetics, life history variability, biogeography, dispersal and movement, etc.) and what this means for management units needs to be further refined. This is a general issue for all nearshore stocks that likely have significant and small scale stock structure among and within states, but limited data collections to support small-scale management.} Response: This recommendation still stands and is included in future research recommendations (see item 5 below).

Recommended avenues for research to help improve future `r spp` stock assessments include (but are not limited to):

1. Continue work on the investigation into the movement, and behavior or mortality of older (> age 10) females to further reconcile their absence in fisheries data. 
2. Conduct population genetics studies on fish observed off of the continental shelf (middle of the gyre and at sea mounts) to determine their association with the nearshore stocks.
3. Continue to build evidence for appropriate natural mortality values for females and males. 
4. Improved historical catch reconstructions. Specifically, the historic trawl fishery catches (pre-1987) in particular require particular attention. Given the huge historical removals of that fleet in each state, the assessment is very sensitive to the assumed functional form of selectivity. A synoptic catch reconstruction is recommended, where states work together to resolve cross-boundary state catch issues as well as standardize the approach to catch recommendations to the extent possible.
5. Stock structure for black rockfish is a complicated topic that needs further analysis. How this is determined (e.g., exploitation history, genetics, life history variability, biogeography, etc.) and what this means for management units needs to be further refined. This is a general issue for all nearshore stocks that likely have significant and small scale stock structure among and within states, but limited data collections to support small-scale management.
6. Continue acoustic-visual fisheries independent coastwide survey to develop a time series. Further refine the survey by addressing the recommendations of the SSC methodology review from 2022. Examine the potential of using spatial modeling to reduce the uncertainty in the population estimates from the acoustic-visual fisheries independent coastwide survey.
7. Reconcile contradictory signal in the Black Rockfish biology versus the population scale.
8. Better understand the ecology and habitats of Black Rockfish from settlement to age 4. Further development of surveys aimed specifically at recruitment or settlement rates of nearshore species, such as OSU’s SMURF collections, that are not frequently encountered in offshore federal age-0 surveys is needed.
