## Model Structure and Assumptions

## Model Structure, Evaluation, and Specification

### Fleet and survey designations

The Oregon model is structured to track several fleets and include data from several surveys:

* Fleet 1: Commerical trawlfishery
* Fleet 2: Commercial non-trawl fishery
* Fleet 4: Recreational ocean boat fishery
* Fleet 5: Recreational shore fishery
* Survey 1: Commercial non-trawl CPUE  
* Survey 2: ORBS CPUE survey
* Survey 3: MRFSS CPUE survey
* Survey 4: MPA CPUE survey
* Survey 5: Acoustic visual survey
* Survey 6: Tagging abundance survey

## Model likelihood components

There are five primary likelihood components for each assessment model:
1. Fit to survey indices of abundance.
2. Fit to length composition samples.
3. Fit to age composition samples (all fit as conditional age-at-length).  
4. Penalties on recruitment deviations (specified differently for each model).
5. Prior distribution penalties

## Reference model exploration, key assumptions and reference model specification

The base assessment model for Oregon `r spp` was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a spawning output trajectory and realtive stock status for the population of `r spp` in state and federal waters off Oregon. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses different data types and sources to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base model. Constructing integrated models (i.e., those fitting many data types) takes considerable model exploration using different configurations of the following treatments:

- Data types
- Parameter treatments: which parameter can, cannot and do not need to be estimated
- Phasing of parameter estimation 
- Data weighting
- Exploration of local vs global minima (see model convergence section below)

The different biological data with and without the catch time series were first included to obtain an understanding of the signal of stock status coming from the data (Figure \ref{fig:modbuild-data-depl}). Both the lengths and ages, with and without the removal time series, demonstrated a signal for a highly depleted stock. Stock scale was comparable once removal history was included, and showed lower estimates of scale. This departure from the ultimate reference model highlights the major uncertainty in the treatment of the biological data in when characterizing model uncertainty. Further sensitivities to the inclusion or exclusion of different indices of abundance are provided in the model sensitivity section.

Numerous exploratory models that included all data types and a variety of model specifications were subsequently explored and too numerous to fully report. In summary, the estimation of which life history parameters to estimate and fix was liberally explored.
The following is a list of things that were explored, typically in combination with one another

- Estimate or fix $M$
- Estimate or fix any of the three growth parameter for each sex
- Estimate or fix the stock-recruit relationship
- Estimate or assume constant recruitment. If estimating recruitment, for what years?
- Estimate or fix survey catchability for each survey
- Estimate additional survey variance for which survey
- Estimate or fix selectivity parameters
- Logistic or dome-shaped selectivity

After much consideration, it was determined that some parameters were inestimable ($M$,$L_min$ for both sexes), some did not move much for initial values and could be fixed (e.g., CV at length values, some selectivity parameters), and others could be estimated (e.g., $L_{\infty}$, $k$, $lnR_0$). The $L_min$ value for both females and males was fixed so $t_0$ = 0, as this gave the most realistic $L_{\infty}$ values. No priors were used on any of the estimated parameters except female $L_{\infty}$ which used a normal prior and a standard deviation taken from the external fit to the gorwth curve (0.17). Length at maturity, fecundity-weight, and length-weight relationship, steepness ($h$) and recruitment variance were all fixed. The full list of estimate and fixed parameters are found in Table \ref{tab:model-param}. 

The biggest uncertainty revealed in the model exploration was conflict in the signal of the biological data and that in the acoustic visual survey catchability. If the inherent uncertainty in the survey (CV = 0.45) was used, additional variance estimated on a lower CV, or the catchability was estimated, the acoustic visual survey was essentially ignored (catchability was between 3 and 4, saying the survey overestimates abundance by 3 to 4 times), the scale and stock status dropped significantly. If the acoustic survey catchability, which was reviewed and deemed informative of overall black rockfish biomass in Oregon, was assumed to be equal to 1, the biomass and stock status was much higher. Given there are serious issues with assuming either of the previous hypotheses are acceptable, the STAT determined a realistic upper bound (based on a calculated catchability from the uncertainty in the acoustic visual survey) for catchability of 1.822 (or $ln(q)$ of 0.6). This served as fixed value of catchability (which also required a small CV of 0.0001 on that index) to build the final reference model around.  

General attributes of the reference model are that indices of abundance are assumed to have lognormal measurement errors. Length compositions and conditional age at length samples are all assumed to follow a multinomial sampling distribution, where the sample size is fixed at the input sample size calculated during compositional example, and where this input sample size is subsequently reweighted to account for additional sources of overdispersion (see below). Recruitment deviations were also estimated are assumed to follow a lognormal distribution, where the standard deviation of this distribution is tuned as explained below.

Sensitivity scenarios and likelihood profiles were used to explore uncertainty in the above model specifications. Likelihood profiles on the catchability of the acoustic visual survey, steepness, and natural mortality were performed. 


### Data Weighting

The reference model allowed for the estimation of additional variance on all surveys except the acostic visual survey. This additional variance allows the model to balance model fit to that data while acknowledging that variances may be underestimated in the index standardization. A sensitivity was run with no extra variance estimated, as well as removal of the index data were explored.

Initial sample sizes for the commercial and recreational length and conditional age-at-length compositions were based on the number of input effetive samples sizes. The method of Francis [-@francis_data_2011, equation TA1.8] was then used to balance the length and conditional age-at-length composition data among other inputs and likelihood components. The Francis method treats mean length and age as indices, with effective sample size defining the variance around the mean. If the variability around the mean does not encompass model predictions, the data should be down-weighted until predictions fit within the intervals. This method accounts for correlation in the data (i.e., the multinomial distribution), but can be sensitive to years that are outliers, as the amount of down-weighting is applied to all years within a data source, and are not year-specific. Sensitivities were performed examining different data-weighting treatments: 1) the Dirichlet-Multinomial approach [@thorson_model-based_2017], 2) the McAllister-Ianelli Harmonic Mean approach [@mcallister_bayesian_1997], or 3) no data-weighting of lengths.



OREGON: While the step in M is similar in concept to the past models use of a ramp in M, the magnitude of that step is much smaller (step from 0.17 to 0.20, rather than a ramp from 0.16 to 0.24). Selectivity also differs from the last model, as well as from the California and Washington models, in the use of both sex-specific length- and age-based selectivity forms. Selectivity for the ascending portion of the selection curves for all five of the fleets was modeled using length-based selection with no differences in length selection by sex.  The trawl fishery assumed asymptotic for both sexes, but with the allowance of a female offset to male selectivity. The live fish fishery selectivity was shared by both sexes (dome-shaped), but the dead fish fishery was modeled as a female offset in the dome-shaped parameters. The recreational ocean fishery used an age-based selectivity offset on the descending limb for females relative to males, which were assumed fully-selected at all ages (length-selectivity was used to describe the active male selectivity in this fishery). Similar to the live fish fishery, the recreational shore was dome-shaped and shared for both sexes. Finally, the catchability parameter for the tagging study was fixed to 0.25.
