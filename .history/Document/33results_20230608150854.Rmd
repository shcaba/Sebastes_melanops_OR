## Reference Model Diagnostics and Results


### Model Convergence and Acceptability

While there is no definitive measure of model convergence, several measures are routinely applied. These criteria include a low maximum gradient (`r model$maximum_gradient_component`), inversion of the Hessian (passed), acceptable fits to data (passed), and reasonable parameter values (passed). 

Model efficiency was explored by doing a short run Bayesian analysis using the Random Walk Metropolis with 4 chains of 2000 draws, keeping all the draws and examining the fast mixing parameters. Those estimated parameters that do not move much from the initial values slow the model down and are recommended to be fixed at the starting value [@monnahan_overcoming_2019]. This resulted in the fixing of 3 selectivity parameters (Figure \ref{fig:pairs_plot_fast}).

An extra effort was given to ensure the model did not rest on a local likelihood minimum. This was done by starting the minimization process from dispersed parameter values away from the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the approach found a better model fit (i.e., minimum negative log-likelihood value). Starting parameters used a jitter shift value of 0.001. This was repeated 100 times with 17 out of 100 runs returned to the reference model likelihood (Figure \ref{fig:jitter}). A better fit, lower negative log-likelihood model was not found in any of remaining 96 runs. The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering and likelihood profiles, the present reference model represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. 


## Base Model Results

#### Fits to the Data
##### Lengths
Fits to the length data are examined based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets. Fits to the annual length composition are shown in [Appendix A](#app_a). 

Pearson residuals of fits to the fishery and MPA survey length data are reasonably small with no distinct patterns (Figure \ref{fig:lt-pearson-resids}), though the shore-based fishery lengths, which are small samples, show a possible recruitment in 1985 that is not seen in the recruitment residuals. 

Model fits to the mean lengths, assuming Francis data-weighting, do not follow the dynamics in means lengths in the relatively small trawl fishery (Figure \ref{fig:trawl-mean-len-fit}). The mean lengths are bit fit in the larger and better sampled non-trawl (Figure \ref{fig:nontrawl-mean-len-fit}) and ocean boat (Figure \ref{fig:ocean-mean-len-fit}) fisheries. Note the poor fit to the MRFSS-era (pre-2003) mean lengths in the ocean boat fishery. Those length are consistently fit higher than the mean, but the samples are much lower than in the ORBS era sampling. A time block in selectivity was attempted when exploring potential model specifications, but the fits were not improved. The shore-based, also poorly sampled, are not fit well and miss what could be a potential recruitment in the mid-1980s (Figure \ref{fig:shore-mean-len-fit}). Fits to the mean length in the MPA length data are generally good (Figure \ref{fig:mpa-mean-len-fit}). All length weighting are near the value of 1 as is expected when using the Francis weighting method. One thing to note is the general lack of contrast in the data over the past two decades.

Aggregate fits over year by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:agg-len-fit}. The two main fisheries (non-trawl and ocean) and the MPA survey show good fits to the aggregated data. The trawl fishery, which requires the asymptotic size of the populations to be much higher than is expected given the age and growth data, is fit less well. But the trawl data does demonstrate that mostly large individuals are present in the deeper trawl fishery, suggesting less availability of those sizes in the shallower non-trawl and recreational fisheries. This is instructive to the fact that the trawl fishery is catching only the largest individuals in the population, thus possibly over representing those length classes in the population, and indicating that the non-trawl and ocean fishery is missing some of those bigger fish (i.e., a dome-shaped selectivity). The shore-based fishery is also being fit poorly, but the fishery is so small it makes little difference to model performance.  

##### Conditional Age at Length
Fits to the mostly sex-specific conditional age at length data are examined based on the age-at-length Pearson residuals, the annual mean ages, and mean age at length by year for the trawl, non-trawl and ocean boat fishery samples. The maximum size of the Pearson residuals for each fleets was fairly small (maximum = 13.44, 12.48, and 13.12 for the trawl, non-trawl and ocean boat samples, respectively; [Appendix B](#app_b)). The biggest residuals were limited, as most of the residuals were small and unnoteworthy and demonstrate the expected shape of the growth curve. There is more contrast in the age data, as the mean age by year increased for all fleets through the most recent years (Figures \ref{fig:trawl-mean-caal}, \ref{fig:nontrawl-mean-caal}, and \ref{fig:ocean-mean-caal}). The mean age for the trawl fishery was between 10-15 years, whereas the mean ages for the non-trawl and ocean boat fishery was between 8 and 10 years. Fits to the mean ages by length bins show acceptable fits consistent with model expectations [Appendix C](#app_c).

##### Marginal Age compositions

Marginal age compositions are not fit in the model, but they are included in order to see how well they fit the reference model without influencing the likelihood [Appendix D](#app_d). Marginal length and age composition cannot be used in the same model ginve the overlap of the same fish in both samples. This is why ages conditioned on lengths are often used with the length compositions. But it still stands that age compositions, instead of lengths, could be used. So adding the marginal age compositions passively (i.e., not contributing to the overall likelihood of the model) can offer insight into how consistent they are with the current model fit. Overall the fits are very good, and in an exploratory model run the length compositions were replaced with the age compositions and a very similar model result was obtained. Thus the conditional age at length compositions coupled with either length or age compositions provide similar results. This is likely due to the fact that the conditional ages capture the underlying age structure sufficiently to following the age structure over time.   

##### Fits to Indices of Abundance

The fits to the five available indices of abundance (not including the acoustic-visual survey which the model was predefined to fit with a lnq=0.6) are generally weak. The best fit index is found for the commercial non-trawl fishery (Figure \ref{fig:nontrawl-index-fit}), with a very good fit of an upward trend in the contemporary time series. In an interesting contrast is the ocean boast survey that covers the same years and shows a very similar selectivity, but shows an opposing downward trend (Figure \ref{fig:nontrawl-index-fit}). The earlier time series for the recreational fishery is also not well fit to the dynamics of the model, and requires high additional variance to fit (Figure \ref{fig:nrfss-index-fit}).

The two fishery independent surveys, the MPA (Figure \ref{fig:mpa-index-fit}) and the tagging survey (Figure \ref{fig:tag-index-fit}) are also not well fit. Despite this, the estimated catchability for the tagging survey is 0.3, not far from the assumed value of 0.25 in the 2015 assessment.


### Reference Model Outputs 
#### Parameter Estimates

A total of five population parameters, five survey variances and sixteen selectivity parameters were estimated, along with thirty-eight recruitment deviations. The reference model parameter estimates along with asymptotic standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:model-param} and the likelihood components are shown in Table \ref{tab:likes}. Estimates of derived reference points and approximate 95 percent asymptotic confidence intervals are provided in Table \ref{tab:referenceES}. 

The estimates of sex-specific growth parameters showed some differences from the externally estimated starting values (Table \ref{tab:model-param} and Figure \ref{fig:len-age-ss}). The estimated $L_{\infty}$ and $k$ for females and males were slightly greater than the values estimated externally (`r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "VonBert_K_Fem_GP_1", 3],3)`  for females and `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "VonBert_K_Fem_GP_1", 3]*exp(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "VonBert_K_Mal_GP_1", 3]),3)` yr^-1^ for males).  The majority of female and male `r spp` growth occurs at younger ages, reaching near maximum length by age 20-25, depending upon sex, with female `r spp` reaching larger maximum lengths (Figure \ref{fig:len-age-ss}).

The time series of estimated recruitment deviations and annual recruitment deviations are shown in Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:rec-devs}. Years with major recruitment deviations were estimated to have occurred  around 1994, 1999-2000, 2008, and 2016. These years are very similar to recruitment deviations seen in other rockfishes. One curious signal is the string of positive deviations from 2010-2014, though this is consistently apparent most model runs. The variance check on the recruitment deviations indicates well informed recruitments from 1985 to 2017, providing justification for the estimation of recruitment (Figure \ref{fig:varcheck}). Recruitment deviations after 2017 are relatively uninformed and are not estimated. The recruitment bias adjustment applied within the model across years is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bias-adj}. The Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship compared to the recruitment deviations are given in Figure \ref{fig:bh-curve}.

Estimated selectivity curves for each fleet and survey (Figure \ref{fig:fleet_selectivity}) look plausible (i.e., as a model convergence check for realism, the selectivity curves must look plausible). The trawl fishery is highly right shifted indicating only the largest individuals are taken by that fishery. Both the non-trawl and the recreational ocean-based fleet (the MRFSS fleet is mirrored to this fleet) demonstrate dome-shaped selectivity and are very similar though the recreational fishery is expected to take more larger individuals. The estimate of the peak size of selectivity for the two biggest removal sources (non-trawl = `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Size_DblN_peak_Non-Trawl_wdis(2)", 3],2)` cm; recreational ocean boat = `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Size_DblN_peak_Ocean(3)", 3],2)` cm) are above the size of 50% functional maturity (40 cm). 

#### Population Trajectory

The predicted spawning output (in millions of eggs) is provided in Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and plotted in Figure \ref{fig:ssb}. Estimated spawning output shows a large decline starting in the late 1970s when the recreational fishery begins in earnest. This decline is consistent until the late 1990s when it then rebounds due to several strong recruitments consistent with other rockfish stock assessments. The estimate of total biomass over time, which tracks that of spawning output, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tot-bio}. This 

Relative spawning output declined below the management target ($SB_{40\%}$) by the 1990s, but quickly rebounded to high relative spawning output, but has declined over the past 10 years (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The relative stock status at the start of `r endyr + 1` (`r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Bratio_2021','Value'], 2)`) is estimated to be well above the rockfish relative biomass target of 0.4. Uncertainty intervals are wide given the number of estimated parameters, and indicate the population never goes below the management target ($SB_{40\%}$). The strong recruitment events that are supported by all fishery-dependent data sources are responsible for the dramatic increase and elevated stock status. Numbers of age-0 individuals indcate those years of particularly strong recruitment (Figure \ref{fig:recruits}).
