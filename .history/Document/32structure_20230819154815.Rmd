## Model Structure, Evaluation, and Specification

### Fleet and Survey Designations

The Oregon model is structured to track several fleets and include data from several surveys:

* Fleet 1: Commercial trawlfishery
* Fleet 2: Commercial non-trawl fishery
* Fleet 3: Recreational ocean boat fishery
* Fleet 4: Recreational shore fishery
* Survey 1: Commercial non-trawl CPUE  
* Survey 2: ORBS CPUE survey
* Survey 3: MRFSS CPUE survey
* Survey 4: MPA CPUE survey
* Survey 5: Acoustic visual survey
* Survey 6: Tagging abundance survey

The specifications of the assessment are listed in Table \ref{tab:model-structure}.


## Model Likelihood Components

There are five primary likelihood components for each assessment model:

1. Fit to survey indices of abundance.
2. Fit to length composition samples (to get the length-based selectivities; these are then dropped in the final reference model).
3. Fit to age composition samples (fit as conditional age-at-length).  
4. Penalties on recruitment deviations (specified differently for each model).
5. Prior distribution penalties

## Reference Model Exploration, Key Assumptions and Specification

The reference assessment model for Oregon `r spp` was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a spawning output trajectory and relative stock status for the population of `r spp` in state and federal waters off Oregon. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses different data types and sources to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final reference model. Constructing integrated models (i.e., those fitting many data types) takes considerable model exploration using different configurations of the following treatments:

- Data types and treatments
- Parameter treatments: which parameter can, cannot and do not need to be estimated
- Phasing of parameter estimation 
- Data weighting
- Exploration of local vs global minima (see model convergence section below)

The different biological data with and without the catch time series were first included to obtain an understanding of the signal of stock status coming from the data (Figure \ref{fig:modbuild-data-depl}). Both the lengths and ages, with and without the removal time series, demonstrated a signal for a highly depleted stock when no recruitment deviations were estimated. When recruitment deviations were estimated, models included ages indicated an increasing stock, as opposed to the lengths that maintained a depressed stock status. The underlying mean size and age data clearly show a relatively steady mean length through time, whereas the ages show an decreasing then increasing mean age indicative of a growing population (see reference model plots for these patterns). Stock scale was comparable once removal history was included. The differences in derived model outputs highlight major uncertainty in the treatment of the biological data when characterizing model uncertainty. Further sensitivities to the inclusion or exclusion of different indices of abundance are detailed in the model sensitivity section.

Numerous exploratory models that included all data types and a variety of model specifications were subsequently explored and too numerous to fully report. In summary, the estimation of which life history parameters to estimate and fix was liberally explored.
The following is a list of things that were explored, typically in combination with one another:

- Estimate or fix $M$
- Estimate or fix any of the three growth parameter for each sex
- Estimate or fix the stock-recruit relationship
- Estimate or assume constant recruitment. If estimating recruitment, for what years?
- Estimate or fix survey catchability for each survey
- Estimate additional survey variance for which survey
- Estimate or fix selectivity parameters
- Logistic or dome-shaped selectivity
- Treatment of sex ratio

Examination of the catches in the trawl fishery indicated much larger fish being caught versus those caught in the commercial non-trawl and recreational ocean boat fisheries (both of which have very similar mean lengths and aggregate catch compositions) in the same years.  Dome-shaped selectivity was therefore allowed in those fisheries as well as the shore-based fleet (which catches much smaller individuals) and the MPA survey. The ORBS and MRFSS surveys were assumed to have the same selectivity as the recreational boat fishery fleet. While constant selectivity was assumed across all fleets, it was also noted that the earlier time series (prior to 2003) of the recreational boat fleet, as sampled by the MRFSS program, had consistently smaller mean lengths than the ORBS sampled years. The MRFSS years also had smaller samples with more uncertainty. Time varying selectivity was explored in the two periods to see if this improved the fit to the data, but no perceivable improvement was made and the resultant difference was very small in the derived model outputs, so a constant selectivity was assumed for the whole time period.

After much consideration of exploratory model runs, it was determined that some parameters were inestimable ($M$,$L_{Amin}$ for both sexes), some did not move much for initial values and could be fixed (e.g., CV at length values, some selectivity parameters), and others could be estimated (e.g., $L_{\infty}$, $k$, $lnR_0$). Estimation of $L_{Amin}$ lead to very large gradients for all other parameters (though not unrealistic estimates of those parameters), and fixing it to the externally estimated values consistently gave very high estimates of $L_{\infty}$ for both sexes, thus the $L_{Amin}$ value for both females and males was fixed so $t_0$ = 0, as this gave the most realistic $L_{\infty}$ values. No priors were used on any of the estimated parameters except female $L_{\infty}$ which used a normal prior and a standard deviation taken from the external fit to the growth curve (0.17). Length at maturity, fecundity-weight, and length-weight relationship, steepness ($h$) and recruitment variance were all fixed. 

The biggest uncertainty revealed in the model exploration was conflict in the signal of the biological data and that in the acoustic visual survey catchability. If the inherent uncertainty in the survey (CV = 0.45) was used, additional variance estimated on a lower CV, or the catchability was estimated, the acoustic visual survey was essentially ignored (catchability was between 3 and 4, saying the survey overestimates abundance by 3 to 4 times), the scale and stock status dropped significantly. If the acoustic survey catchability, reviewed and deemed informative of overall black rockfish biomass in Oregon [@Rasmuson_etal_SSC_2022], was assumed to be equal to 1, the biomass and stock status was much higher. Given there are serious issues with assuming either of the previous hypotheses are acceptable, the STAT determined a realistic upper bound (based on a calculated catchability from the uncertainty in the acoustic visual survey) for catchability of 1.822 (or $ln(q)$ of 0.6). This served as fixed value of catchability (which also required a small CV of 0.0001 on that index) to build the reference model presented to the STAR panel. The proposed higher and lower states of nature, respectively, then assumed either the acoustic visual catchability was known with a value of 1 with little error or the tag and acoustic visual surveys were essentially ignored by freely estimating the acoustic survey catchability, with the length data being the main source of stock status information in the population.

### Pre-STAR Panel explorations and development of the final reference model

The pre-STAR Panel draft assessment outlined a variety of sensitivities and likelihood profiles to characterize the uncertainty in the proposed reference model given the internal estimate of uncertainty (a standard deviation of 0.01) was unreliably low. As these pertain to the final development of the reference model, they are included in their entirety. 

#### Data treatment sensitivities
Data treatments explored included the treatment of catchability for the acoustic visual survey and the tagging data, the removal of any one data source, and alternative approaches to data weighting. All scenarios match the reference model specifications in all other aspects unless otherwise stated.

- Treatment of absolute abundance catchability (q) 
	1. Acoustic visual survey q = 1, CV = 0.0001
  	2. Acoustic visual survey q Estimated, CV = 0.0001
  	3. Acoustic visual survey q = 1, CV = 0.45
  	4. Acoustic visual survey q estimated, CV = 0.45
  	5. Tag survey q = to 2015 value (0.25) with #2 above
  	6. Tag survey q = to 2015 value (0.25), but extra variance estimated, with #2 above

- Remove abundance index series 
	7. No Acoustic visual
  	8. No tagging index
  	9. No non-trawl index
  	10. No ORBS index
  	11. No MRFSS index
  	12. No MPA index
	13. Add SMURFs index 

- Data weighting (Table \ref{tab:data_wt})
  	14. No data-weighting
  	15. Dirichlet data-weighting
  	16. McAllister-Ianelli data weighting
	17. 2015 Catch history

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters and derived quantities from each data treatment sensitivity are available in Tables \ref{tab:data_sensis_q_preSTAR} and \ref{tab:data_sensis_other_preSTAR}. Derived quantities relative to the reference model are provided in Figure \ref{fig:sensi-data-RE_preSTAR}. Time series of spawning output and relative spawning output are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sensi-data-ssb_preSTAR} and \ref{fig:sensi-data-depl_preSTAR}. 

From a data standpoint, these sensitivities indicate the model was most sensitive to how information on absolute abundance, or population scale, from the acoustic visual survey and the tagging data was treated in the model.  In particular, the parameterization of catchability (model estimated or fixed) and the level of error (input CVs and model estimated extra variance) associated with these two data sources provided considerably discrepencies in key management quantities (e.g., stock size and status; Figures \ref{fig:sensi-data-RE_preSTAR}, \ref{fig:sensi-data-ssb_preSTAR}, and \ref{fig:sensi-data-depl_preSTAR}). The model was comparatively robust to the removal of any given single data source, with the exception of the acoustic visual survey, and the relative weighting of length and age composition data. The harmonic mean data weighting approach (based on the McAllister-Ianelli method) resulted in negligible change from the reference model that used the Francis weighting method.  The Dirichlet method only minimally adjusted the input sample sizes, nearly mimicking the sensitivity model where no weighting was conducted, which had the effect of increasing current estimates of stock size (20%) but no appreciably change in stock status. 

Alternative treatment of the acoustic visual survey data largely resulted in two alternative states of nature in terms of stock size and status (high and low) relative to the reference model. Fixing catchability to 1.0 and reducing the input CV to near zero essentially forced the model to fit the 2021 acoustic-survey data point perfectly (high state of nature). However, when doing so the model estimated biological parameters (e.g., natural mortality and growth) that were extreme, nearing implausibility. Alternatively, estimating catchability, or similarly inputting the externally estimated CV of 0.45, resulted in a low state of nature where estimates of spawning output over recent years were below OFLs and stock status was in the precautionary zone. However, the interpretation of resulting acoustic-survey catchability was impractically high (3.0 or higher) given the comprehensive study design of the survey. Fixing the tagging catchability to the value assumed in the last assessment largely counteracts the change to the reference model after fixing the acoustic visual catchability to 1.0 and reducing its input CV to near zero.  

#### Model specification sensitivities
Model specifications looked at the estimation of individual and combinations of life history parameters, including the treatment of natural mortality, growth, maturity, fecundity and recruitment, and fishery selectivity. All scenarios match the reference model specifications in all other aspects unless otherwise stated.

	- Natural mortality ($M$)
		1. Use 2015 $M$ values 
		2. Lorenzen age varying $M$
		3. Estimate $M$

	- Growth parameters
	 	4. Fix all growth parameters to external values, estimate $M$
		5. Fix all growth parameters to external values
	 	6. Estimate $L_{Amin}$
	 	7. Estimate $CV_{young}$ and $CV_{old}$

	- Reproductive Biology
	 	8. Use biological maturity ogive (logistic model)
	 	9. Use functional maturity ogive (logistic model)
	 	10. Fecundity proportional to weight

	- Recruitment estimation
	 	11. No recruitment estimation
	 	12. Estimate recruitment for all years in the model

 - Selectivity  
		13. Estimate logistic selectivity for all fleets
	
Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters and derived quantities from each model specification sensitivity are available in Table \ref{tab:modspec_sensis_preSTAR}. Derived quantities relative to the reference model are provided in Figure \ref{fig:sensi-modspec-RE_preSTAR}. Time series of spawning output and relative spawning output are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sensi-modspec-ssb_preSTAR} and \ref{fig:sensi-modspec-depl_preSTAR}. In general, model specifications for natural mortality, selectivity, and growth caused the population to drop below the reference model estimate of stock size, while alternative reproductive biology models increased stock size.  Despite considerable differences in the historic trajectory of relative stock status across sensitivity models, there was considerably less variability in the estimate of current (2023) stock status (ranging from 0.49 to 0.65, where 0.55 is the reference model, with the exception of the estimate $L_{Amin}$ growth model that had convergence issues when estimating the length at minimum age). 

Estimating female and male $M$ led to a considerably higher mortality rate for females (0.25 compared to 0.19 used in the reference model) and slightly higher for males (0.18 compared to 0.17). This had the effect of lowering both the beginning and ending stock scale, but had only a marginal influence on current stock status. Similarly, fixing growth but estimating $M$ also dropped stock scale but preserved stock status relative to the sensitivity that only fixed the growth parameters to external estimates. Due to the similarity between $M$ in the reference model and what was used in the previous 2015 assessment, there was little change in overall management quantities associated with this sensitivity model.    

Fixing growth parameters in the model to external-to-the-assessment estimates resulted in a considerable change in the stock trajectory, both in terms of stock size and status, yet end up in about the same place by 2023. For example, over the most recent 20 years, this sensitivity model estimates the stock declining from a nearly unfished state in the early 2000s. In contrast, the reference model (and nearly all other sensitivity model) estimate the stock has been increasing from a precautionary state in the early 2000s. Estimating the CV for growth of young and old fish had negligible impact on results. The model that estimated $L_{Amin}$ did not pass key model diagnostic tests (e.g., stability and convergence) so was not considered further. 

Using a logistic function to externally estimate maturity ogives, based on either biological or functional maturity measurements, increased scale and overall spawning output relative to the reference model.  This result was most prominent when biological maturity was used to describe the maturity schedule due to the appreciable reduction in the length at 50 percent maturity indicating that females mature at a younger age on average than when using functional maturity (Figure \ref{fig:bio-fxn-mat-color}). The minor differences between using a logistic function (sensitivity) versus a spline (reference model) was due to the latter allowing for skip spawning of older, mature females. Assuming that fecundity is proportional to female body weight, instead of an exponential relationship with length as used in the reference model, resulted in an increase in beginning and ending scale but little difference in overall stock status.

Recruitment estimation (assuming $\sigma_R$ = 0.6) was sensitive to the estimation of different ranges of years of recruitment deviations. While the truncated time series of recruitment used in the reference model can be considered parsimonious, the addition of estimating all recruitment years adds additional uncertainty to the stock status measure earlier in the time series. Estimating recruitment deviations for all years in the model dropped the scale of the population, altered the historic stock status trajectory, but had little effect on current stock status. Estimating the full time series of recruitments resulted in a significant negative trend in deviates early in the time period that was a concern. Removing the estimation of any recruitment deviates from the stock-recruitment curve resulted in reduced stock dynamics, where the decline in stock status from an unfished state was gradual and largely driven by the catch history.  

Estimating all fleet selectivity patterns as logistic effectively removed the potential for cryptic biomass resulting from fleets not encountering and catching fish of older sizes or ages. This model resulted in an decrease in beginning and ending scale and reduced stock status since 1990 (even to the point where the stock would have been considered overfished from the 1990s to the early 2010s). The stock status discrepancy is reduced the closer the model gets to the current year, where the fraction of unfished is estimated to be 53 percent in 2023 compared to the pre-STAR reference model of 55 percent. The fit to the logistic selectivity model is not as good in terms of residual patterns and overall likelihood (based on AIC).  


#### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for the acoustic-visual survey catchability (q) in natural log-space (ln($q$)), steepness ($h$), and female and male natural mortality ($M$) varying together with a constant ratio matching the reference model (0.19/0.17, female and male values respectively). Likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the featured parameter(s) at specific values across a range of values and estimating all remaining parameters. A likelihood profile offers insight into model sensitivity to changing model parameter values, while providing an additional way to describe uncertainty in the parameter by identifying the range of parameters within 1.96 likelihood units of the reference model.

The profile on the assumption of the acoustic-visual survey catchability demonstrates the expected scaling up and down of the population with the decrease and increase of the catchability, respectively (Figure \ref{fig:AVq-profile}). The change in the current spawning output is steeper than the initial spawning output, leading to a steep decline in relative biomass as ln($q$) gets larger. As the ln($q$) approaches 1.5, the stock approaches the overfished limit reference point. The most supported value of the ln($q$) is found near 1.17 with a very tight support interval. The most prominent length data (in samples and associated fisheries) support larger ln($q$) values, while age compositions support smaller ln($q$) values near the value used in the reference model (Figure \ref{fig:AVq-profile-components}). The less informed survey indices support larger ln($q$) values on the strength of the best fit index (non-trawl CPUE index).

The steepness profile showed little information content for this parameter (Figure \ref{fig:steepness-profile}) as the best fit value went towards the bound of 1. Changing steepness mostly changed the estimate of initial stock size, with a higher initial stock size needed to make up for the lower recruitment compensation. Overall, the relative stock size changed little across a large range of steepness values. The biological compositions pushed the steepness to the highest value, whereas the index data indicated a mixed signal for the lowest and highest steepness values (Figure \ref{fig:steepness-profile-components}).
 
The combined profile that varies female and male $M$ while maintaining the reference model offset demonstrated what had be seen in the model development, that when freely estimated, the model wants natural mortality values to be unreasonably high (Figure \ref{fig:M-multiprofile-combo}). All likelihood components confirm the drive for higher $M$ values for both sexes (Figures \ref{fig:M-multiprofile-like-components} to \ref{fig:M-multiprofile-survey-components}). Given the highly constrained model specification (i.e., a fix q on a survey), the range of reasonable natural mortality values adjust the scale of the population in order to match the value fixed in 2021. Similar to the steepness profile, the lower natural mortality values lead to lower productivity, and thus the need for a higher initial biomass, which changes quicker than the current, more pinned down, current biomass value. While the scale does change substantially, the current relative stock status is fairly stable and always above the target level.

#### Additional STAR Panel sensitivities

Further discussions in the 2023 STAR Panel lead to several additional model runs exploring alternatives to pinning the model to a precise interpretation of the acoustic-visual survey (i.e., low variance and set catchability). These explorations included using different target strength values for `r spp` to estimate input values from the acoustic visual survey and different approaches to the weighting of the length compositions or the acoustic visual survey, in combination with freely estimating or fixing the acoustic visual survey q. 

### Final reference model

The final reference model used length-based selectivities fixed to those estimated in the original reference model, retained the conditional age-at-length compositions, fixed the acoustic-visual survey catchability to 1 and retained the input variance (CV = 0.45), then ran the model with the remaining specification as in the original model. The full list of estimate and fixed parameters are found in Table \ref{tab:model-params}. 

General attributes of the reference model are as follows. Indices of abundance are assumed to have lognormal measurement errors. Biological compositions are all assumed to follow a multinomial sampling distribution, where the sample size is fixed at the input sample size calculated during compositional example, and where this input sample size is subsequently re-weighted to account for additional sources of overdispersion (see below). Recruitment deviations were also estimated are assumed to follow a lognormal distribution, where the standard deviation of this distribution is tuned as explained below.

Sensitivity scenarios and likelihood profiles (on the catchability of the acoustic visual survey, steepness, and natural mortality) were used to explore uncertainty in the above model specifications and are reported below. 

### Data Weighting

The reference model allowed for the estimation of additional variance on all surveys except the acoustic visual survey. This additional variance allows the model to balance model fit to that data while acknowledging that variances may be underestimated in the index standardization. A sensitivity was run with no extra variance estimated, as well as removal of the index data were explored.

Initial sample sizes for the commercial and recreational length and conditional age-at-length compositions were based on the number of input effective samples sizes. The method of Francis [-@francis_data_2011, equation TA1.8] was then used to balance the length and conditional age-at-length composition data among other inputs and likelihood components. The Francis method treats mean length and age as indices, with effective sample size defining the variance around the mean. If the variability around the mean does not encompass model predictions, the data should be down-weighted until predictions fit within the intervals. This method accounts for correlation in the data (i.e., the multinomial distribution), but can be sensitive to years that are outliers, as the amount of down-weighting is applied to all years within a data source, and are not year-specific. Sensitivities were performed examining different data-weighting treatments: 1) the Dirichlet-Multinomial approach [@thorson_model-based_2017], 2) the McAllister-Ianelli Harmonic Mean approach [@mcallister_bayesian_1997], or 3) no data-weighting of lengths. The weights applied to each length and age data set for the reference model are shown in Table \ref{tab:data_wt}.


### Model Changes from the Last Assessment

Besides the additional of eight years of data, changes to some historical data series, and some changes in the estimation of some parameters, the biggest changes to the past assessment are:

- Addition of and fixing to the acoustic visual survey. This is different than the last model that fixed the stock scale to the tag survey catchability 
- Estimation of recruitment
- Female natural mortality is no longer a step, but a constant value
- Length-based selectivity only (i.e., no age-based selectivity for females), and dome-shaped selectivity for the ocean boat fisheries (assumed logistic last time)
- Use of an updated functional maturity relationship
- Changes in the removal history
- composition data not constrained to inform sex ratio
