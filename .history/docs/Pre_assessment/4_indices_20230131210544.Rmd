# Indices of Abundance

## Fishery-Independent 

There are four fishery-independent surveys that will be explored and considered:

* Adult tagging index (2002-2013, excluded 2002 - 2004 based on ODFW recommendation) - central Oregon pit tagging project
* Adult acoustic survey (2021) - Oregon coastwide hydroacoustic survey developed for mid-water rockfish
* OR marine reserves hook and line survey (2013 - 2022) - standardized hook and line survey in Oregon's marine reserve network (surveys similar to CA reserve H&L survey)
* SMURFS juvenile index (tentatively, 2011-2022) - YOY rockfish survey in two locations in Oregon's marine reserves

Only the first was included in the 2015 assessment. Selectivity for this survey was mirrored to the ocean-boat fleet in the 2015 assessment. The first two are potential measures of absolute abundance, the third of relative abundance, and the final could be used as an indicator of recruitment.


## Fishery-Dependent 

There are four fishery-dependent surveys that will be developed for consideration:

* MRFSS dockside index (1980 - 2000) - MRFSS dockside interviews of ocean boat trips
* ORBS dockside index (2001 - 2022) - ORBS dockside interviews of ocean boat trips
* Oregon on-board observer index (2001, 2003 - 2022) - state observed charter boat trips
* Oregon nearshore logbook index (2003 - 2022) - commercial nearshore fixed gear trips

All four of these were included in the 2015 assessment.
