# Indices of Abundance

## Fishery-Independent 

There are three fishery-independent surveys that will be explored and considered:

* Adult tagging index (2002-20??) 
* Adult acoustic survey ()
* SMURFS juvenile index ()

Only the first was included in the 2015 assessment. The first two are potential measures of absolute abundance, and the third could be used as an indicator of recruitment.



## Fishery-Dependent 

There are three fishery-dependent surveys that will be developed for consideration:

* MRFSS dockside index (1980-2000)
* ORBS dockside index (2001-present)
* Oregon on-board observer index (2001,2003-present)
* Oregon nearshore logbook index ()

The first three were included in the 2015 assessment.
