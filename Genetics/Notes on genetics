black rockfish genetics (Hess et al.)
*Alaska diff than continental US
*Brookings is an outlier-- maybe something special going on there? Miller et al. 2005 had also found something interesting there.
*Sig decrease in genetic diversity north of Columbia river
*North of Mendo is a drop in diversity, then goes back up in Oregon
*Isolation by distance seen in CA south of Mendo. Intersting area near SF Bay
*General isloation by distance trends are short along the coast and grouped by areas, so not continuous
*All samples from this study has come from 2005.
